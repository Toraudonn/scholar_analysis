Nevertheless, choosing the norms to regulate a society is by no means straightforward. The reasons are twofold. First, the norms to choose from may not be independent (i.e, they can be related to each other). Second, different preference criteria may be applied when choosing the norms to enact. This paper advances the state of the art by modeling a series of decision-making problems that regulation authorities confront when choosing the policies to establish. In order to do so, we first identify three different norm relationships -namely, generalisation, exclusivity, and substitutability- and we then consider norm representation power, cost, and associated moral values as alternative preference criteria. Thereafter, we show that the decision-making problems faced by policy makers can be encoded as linear programs, and hence solved with the aid of state-of-the-art solvers.|norm extens propos coordin mechan agent human societi nevertheless choos norm regul societi mean straightforward reason twofold first norm choos may independ relat second differ prefer criteria may appli choos norm enact paper advanc state art model seri decis make problem regul author confront choos polici establish order first identifi three differ norm relationship name generalis exclus substitut consid norm represent power cost associ moral valu altern prefer criteria thereaft show decis make problem face polici maker encod linear program henc solv aid state art solver|['Maite Lopez-Sanchez', 'Marc Serramia', 'Juan A.

Our approach is based on optimization-based maneuver planning that supports dynamic lane-changes, swerving, and braking in all traffic scenarios and guides the vehicle to its goal position. We take into account various traffic constraints, including collision avoidance with other vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists using control velocity obstacles. We use a data-driven approach to model the vehicle dynamics for control and collision avoidance. Furthermore, our trajectory computation algorithm takes into account traffic rules and behaviors, such as stopping at intersections and stoplights, based on an arc-spline representation. We have evaluated our algorithm in a simulated environment and tested its interactive performance in urban and highway driving scenarios with tens of vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists. These scenarios include jaywalking pedestrians, sudden stops from high speeds, safely passing cyclists, a vehicle suddenly swerving into the roadway, and high-density traffic where the vehicle must change lanes to progress more effectively.|present autonovi novel algorithm autonom vehicl navig support dynam maneuv satisfi traffic constraint norm approach base optim base maneuv plan support dynam lane chang swerv brake traffic scenario guid vehicl goal posit take account various traffic constraint includ collis avoid vehicl pedestrian cyclist use control veloc obstacl use data driven approach model vehicl dynam control collis avoid furthermor trajectori comput algorithm take account traffic rule behavior stop intersect stoplight base arc spline represent evalu algorithm simul environ test interact perform urban highway drive scenario ten vehicl pedestrian cyclist scenario includ jaywalk pedestrian sudden stop high speed safe pass cyclist vehicl sudden swerv roadway high densiti traffic vehicl must chang lane progress effect|['Andrew Best', 'Sahil Narang', 'Lucas Pasqualin', 'Daniel Barber', 'Dinesh Manocha']|['cs.RO', 'cs.MA']

The event-based design is shown to emulate the performance of a centralised state observer design up to guaranteed bounds, but with reduced communication. The stability results for state estimation are extended to the distributed control system that results when the local estimates are used for feedback control.

A main property of this distributed algorithm is that it only requires agents to exchange constant-size communication messages. The convergence of this algorithm is discussed and rigorously analyzed. In addition, we aim to address the problem of designing communication topologies and weightings that are optimal for second-order methods. To this end, we propose an effective approximation which is loosely based on completing the square to address the NP-hard bilinear optimization involved in the design.

In contrast to previous work on control of the Fokker-Planck equation, a zero-flux boundary condition is imposed on the partial differential equation that governs the swarm probability distribution, and only bounded vector fields are considered to be admissible as control parameters. Under these constraints, we show that any initial probability distribution can be transported to a target probability distribution under certain assumptions on the regularity of the target distribution. In particular, we show that if the target distribution is (essentially) bounded, has bounded first-order and second-order partial derivatives, and is bounded from below by a strictly positive constant, then this distribution can be reached exactly using a drift vector field that is bounded in space and time. Our proof is constructive and based on classical linear semigroup theoretic concepts.|consid problem control spatiotempor probabl distribut robot swarm evolv accord reflect diffus process use space time depend drift vector field paramet control variabl contrast previous work control fokker planck equat zero flux boundari condit impos partial differenti equat govern swarm probabl distribut onli bound vector field consid admiss control paramet constraint show ani initi probabl distribut transport target probabl distribut certain assumpt regular target distribut particular show target distribut essenti bound bound first order second order partial deriv bound strict posit constant distribut reach exact use drift vector field bound space time proof construct base classic linear semigroup theoret concept|['Karthik Elamvazhuthi', 'Hendrik Kuiper', 'Spring Berman']|['cs.SY', 'cs.MA', 'math.OC']

Notwithstanding, in this paper we provide the first scalable, curvature-dependent algorithm for their approximate solution, that is valid for any number of attacks or failures, and which, for functions with low curvature, guarantees superior approximation performance.

Examples of such networks are models of opinion dynamics over signed graphs, recently introduced by Altafini (2012,2013) and extended to discrete-time case by Meng et al. (2014). It has been shown that under mild connectivity assumptions these protocols provide the convergence of opinions in absolute value, whereas their signs may differ. This ""modulus consensus"" may correspond to the polarization of the opinions (or bipartite consensus, including the usual consensus as a special case), or their convergence to zero. In this paper, we demonstrate that the phenomenon of modulus consensus in the discrete-time Altafini model is a manifestation of a more general and profound fact, regarding the solutions of a special recurrent inequality. Although such a recurrent inequality does not provide the uniqueness of a solution, it can be shown that, under some natural assumptions, each of its bounded solutions has a limit and, moreover, converges to consensus. A similar property has previously been established for special continuous-time differential inequalities (Proskurnikov, Cao, 2016). Besides analysis of signed networks, we link the consensus properties of recurrent inequalities to the convergence analysis of distributed optimization algorithms and the problems of Schur stability of substochastic matrices."|recent dynam sign network tie among agent posit attract negat repuls attract substanti attent research communiti exampl network model opinion dynam sign graph recent introduc altafini extend discret time case meng et al shown mild connect assumpt protocol provid converg opinion absolut valu wherea sign may differ modulus consensus may correspond polar opinion bipartit consensus includ usual consensus special case converg zero paper demonstr phenomenon modulus consensus discret time altafini model manifest general profound fact regard solut special recurr inequ although recurr inequ doe provid uniqu solut shown natur assumpt bound solut limit moreov converg consensus similar properti previous establish special continu time differenti inequ proskurnikov cao besid analysi sign network link consensus properti recurr inequ converg analysi distribut optim algorithm problem schur stabil substochast matric|['Anton V.

This is a common problem that arises in many agent-based simulation studies, and is of central importance in the context of High Level Architecture (HLA), where it is at the core of the Data Distribution Management (DDM) service. Several realizations of the DDM service have been proposed; however, many of them are either inefficient or inherently sequential. These are serious limitations since multicore processors are now ubiquitous, and DDM algorithms -- being CPU-intensive -- could benefit from additional computing power. We propose a parallel version of the Sort-Based Matching algorithm for shared-memory multiprocessors. Sort-Based Matching is one of the most efficient serial algorithms for the DDM problem, but is quite difficult to parallelize due to data dependencies. We describe the algorithm and compute its asymptotic running time; we complete the analysis by assessing its performance and scalability through extensive experiments on two commodity multicore systems based on a dual socket Intel Xeon processor, and a single socket Intel Core i7 processor.|paper consid problem identifi intersect two set dimension axi parallel rectangl common problem aris mani agent base simul studi central import context high level architectur hla core data distribut manag ddm servic sever realize ddm servic propos howev mani either ineffici inher sequenti serious limit sinc multicor processor ubiquit ddm algorithm cpu intens could benefit addit comput power propos parallel version sort base match algorithm share memori multiprocessor sort base match one effici serial algorithm ddm problem quit difficult parallel due data depend describ algorithm comput asymptot run time complet analysi assess perform scalabl extens experi two commod multicor system base dual socket intel xeon processor singl socket intel core processor|"['Moreno Marzolla', ""Gabriele D'Angelo""]"|['cs.DC', 'cs.DS', 'cs.MA']

The aim is to determine the difference between the local and global frames, described by a rotation and a translation. In the noiseless case, global coordinates were recovered exactly by solving a system of linear equations.

This paper formalizes the concept of macro-observations in Decentralized Partially Observable Semi-Markov Decision Processes (Dec-POSMDPs), allowing scalable semantic-level multi-robot decision making. A hierarchical Bayesian approach is used to model noise statistics of low-level classifier outputs, while simultaneously allowing sharing of domain noise characteristics between classes.

The macro-observation scheme is then integrated into a Dec-POSMDP planner, with hardware experiments running onboard a team of dynamic quadrotors in a challenging domain where noise-agnostic filtering fails.

To develop a formal framework for desirable weighting schemes, we draw on no-regret learning. Specifically, given a voting rule, we wish to design a weighting scheme such that applying the voting rule, with voters weighted by the scheme, leads to choices that are almost as good as those endorsed by the best voter in hindsight. We derive possibility and impossibility results for the existence of such weighting schemes, depending on whether the voting rule and the weighting scheme are deterministic or randomized, as well as on the social choice axioms satisfied by the voting rule.|vote system typic treat voter equal argu perhap voter support good choic past given higher weight voter support bad one develop formal framework desir weight scheme draw regret learn specif given vote rule wish design weight scheme appli vote rule voter weight scheme lead choic almost good endors best voter hindsight deriv possibl imposs result exist weight scheme depend whether vote rule weight scheme determinist random well social choic axiom satisfi vote rule|['Nika Haghtalab', 'Ritesh Noothigattu', 'Ariel D.

However, most current RL-based approaches fail to generalize since: (a) the gap between simulation and real world is so large that policy-learning approaches fail to transfer; (b) even if policy learning is done in real world, the data scarcity leads to failed generalization from training to test scenarios (e.g., due to different friction or object masses). Inspired from H-infinity control methods, we note that both modeling errors and differences in training and test scenarios can be viewed as extra forces/disturbances in the system. This paper proposes the idea of robust adversarial reinforcement learning (RARL), where we train an agent to operate in the presence of a destabilizing adversary that applies disturbance forces to the system. The jointly trained adversary is reinforced -- that is, it learns an optimal destabilization policy. We formulate the policy learning as a zero-sum, minimax objective function. Extensive experiments in multiple environments (InvertedPendulum, HalfCheetah, Swimmer, Hopper and Walker2d) conclusively demonstrate that our method (a) improves training stability; (b) is robust to differences in training/test conditions; and c) outperform the baseline even in the absence of the adversary.|deep neural network coupl fast simul improv comput led recent success field reinforc learn rl howev current rl base approach fail general sinc gap simul real world larg polici learn approach fail transfer even polici learn done real world data scarciti lead fail general train test scenario due differ friction object mass inspir infin control method note model error differ train test scenario view extra forc disturb system paper propos idea robust adversari reinforc learn rarl train agent oper presenc destabil adversari appli disturb forc system joint train adversari reinforc learn optim destabil polici formul polici learn zero sum minimax object function extens experi multipl environ invertedpendulum halfcheetah swimmer hopper walkerd conclus demonstr method improv train stabil robust differ train test condit outperform baselin even absenc adversari|['Lerrel Pinto', 'James Davidson', 'Rahul Sukthankar', 'Abhinav Gupta']|['cs.LG', 'cs.AI', 'cs.MA', 'cs.RO']

In this paper, we introduce a technique for speeding up multi-agent learning by exploiting concurrent and incremental experience sharing. This solution adaptively identifies opportunities to transfer experiences between agents and allows for the rapid acquisition of appropriate policies in large-scale, stochastic, homogeneous multi-agent systems. We introduce an online, distributed, supervisor-directed transfer technique for constructing high-level characterizations of an agent's dynamic learning environment---called contexts---which are used to identify groups of agents operating under approximately similar dynamics within a short temporal window. A set of supervisory agents computes contextual information for groups of subordinate agents, thereby identifying candidates for experience sharing. Our method uses a tiered architecture to propagate, with low communication overhead, state, action, and reward data amongst the members of each dynamically-identified information-sharing group. We applied this method to a large-scale distributed task allocation problem with hundreds of information-sharing agents operating in an unknown, non-stationary environment. We demonstrate that our approach results in significant performance gains, that it is robust to noise-corrupted or suboptimal context features, and that communication costs scale linearly with the supervisor-to-subordinate ratio.|one key challeng multi agent learn scalabl paper introduc techniqu speed multi agent learn exploit concurr increment experi share solut adapt identifi opportun transfer experi agent allow rapid acquisit appropri polici larg scale stochast homogen multi agent system introduc onlin distribut supervisor direct transfer techniqu construct high level character agent dynam learn environ call context use identifi group agent oper approxim similar dynam within short tempor window set supervisori agent comput contextu inform group subordin agent therebi identifi candid experi share method use tier architectur propag low communic overhead state action reward data amongst member dynam identifi inform share group appli method larg scale distribut task alloc problem hundr inform share agent oper unknown non stationari environ demonstr approach result signific perform gain robust nois corrupt suboptim context featur communic cost scale linear supervisor subordin ratio|['Dan Garant', 'Bruno da Silva', 'Victor Lesser', 'Chongjie Zhang']|['cs.MA']

Two widely-studied randomized mechanisms in multiagent settings are the Random Serial Dictatorship (RSD) and the Probabilistic Serial Rule (PS). Both mechanisms require only that agents specify ordinal preferences and have a number of desirable economic and computational properties. However, the induced outcomes of the mechanisms are often incomparable and thus there are challenges when it comes to deciding which mechanism to adopt in practice. In this paper, we first consider the space of general ordinal preferences and provide empirical results on the (in)comparability of RSD and PS. We analyze their respective economic properties under general and lexicographic preferences. We then instantiate utility functions with the goal of gaining insights on the manipulability, efficiency, and envyfreeness of the mechanisms under different risk-attitude models.

However, existing multi-agent RL methods typically scale poorly in the problem size. Therefore, a key challenge is to translate the success of deep learning on single-agent RL to the multi-agent setting. A key stumbling block is that independent Q-learning, the most popular multi-agent RL method, introduces nonstationarity that makes it incompatible with the experience replay memory on which deep RL relies. This paper proposes two methods that address this problem: 1) conditioning each agent's value function on a footprint that disambiguates the age of the data sampled from the replay memory and 2) using a multi-agent variant of importance sampling to naturally decay obsolete data. Results on a challenging decentralised variant of StarCraft unit micromanagement confirm that these methods enable the successful combination of experience replay with multi-agent RL.|mani real world problem network packet rout urban traffic control natur model multi agent reinforc learn rl problem howev exist multi agent rl method typic scale poor problem size therefor key challeng translat success deep learn singl agent rl multi agent set key stumbl block independ learn popular multi agent rl method introduc nonstationar make incompat experi replay memori deep rl reli paper propos two method address problem condit agent valu function footprint disambigu age data sampl replay memori use multi agent variant import sampl natur decay obsolet data result challeng decentralis variant starcraft unit micromanag confirm method enabl success combin experi replay multi agent rl|['Jakob Foerster', 'Nantas Nardelli', 'Gregory Farquhar', 'Philip.

In the context of Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), approaches like difference rewards and resource abstraction have shown promising results in tackling such problems. Resource abstraction was shown to be an ideal candidate for solving large-scale resource allocation problems in a fully decentralized manner. However, its performance and applicability strongly depends on some, until now, undocumented assumptions. Two of the main congestion benchmark problems considered in the literature are: the Beach Problem Domain and the Traffic Lane Domain. In both settings the highest system utility is achieved when overcrowding one resource and keeping the rest at optimum capacity. We analyse how abstract grouping can promote this behaviour and how feasible it is to apply this approach in a real-world domain (i.e., what assumptions need to be satisfied and what knowledge is necessary). We introduce a new test problem, the Road Network Domain (RND), where the resources are no longer independent, but rather part of a network (e.g., road network), thus choosing one path will also impact the load on other paths having common road segments. We demonstrate the application of state-of-the-art MARL methods for this new congestion model and analyse their performance. RND allows us to highlight an important limitation of resource abstraction and show that the difference rewards approach manages to better capture and inform the agents about the dynamics of the environment.|congest problem omnipres today complex network repres challeng mani research domain context multi agent reinforc learn marl approach like differ reward resourc abstract shown promis result tackl problem resourc abstract shown ideal candid solv larg scale resourc alloc problem fulli decentr manner howev perform applic strong depend undocu assumpt two main congest benchmark problem consid literatur beach problem domain traffic lane domain set highest system util achiev overcrowd one resourc keep rest optimum capac analys abstract group promot behaviour feasibl appli approach real world domain assumpt need satisfi knowledg necessari introduc new test problem road network domain rnd resourc longer independ rather part network road network thus choos one path also impact load path common road segment demonstr applic state art marl method new congest model analys perform rnd allow us highlight import limit resourc abstract show differ reward approach manag better captur inform agent dynam environ|['Roxana Rădulescu', 'Peter Vrancx', 'Ann Nowé']|['cs.MA', 'cs.AI', '68T05', 'I.2.11']

These problems are typically discretized before running an election or decided upon through negotiation by representatives. We propose a meta-algorithm called \emph{Iterative Local Voting} for collective decision-making in this setting, in which voters are sequentially sampled and asked to modify a candidate solution within some local neighborhood of its current value, as defined by a ball in some chosen norm. In general, such schemes do not converge, or, when they do, the resulting solution does not have a natural description.   We first prove the convergence of this algorithm under appropriate choices of neighborhoods to plausible solutions in certain natural settings: when the voters' utilities can be expressed in terms of some form of distance from their ideal solution, and when these utilities are additively decomposable across dimensions. In many of these cases, we obtain convergence to the societal welfare maximizing solution.

We also propose distributed online Thompson sampling (DOTS) as an effective instantiation of the DOOLP framework. DOTS models sequences of agent choices by concatenating a number of multiarmed bandits for each agent and uses Thompson sampling for dealing with action value uncertainty.

The location of the target at each time induces a global time-varying loss function, and the global loss is a sum of local losses, each of which is associated to one agent. Agents noisy observations could be nonlinear. We formulate this problem as a distributed online optimization where agents communicate with each other to track the minimizer of the global loss. We then propose a decentralized version of the Mirror Descent algorithm and provide the non-asymptotic analysis of the problem. Using the notion of dynamic regret, we measure the performance of our algorithm versus its offline counterpart in the centralized setting. We prove that the bound on dynamic regret scales inversely in the network spectral gap, and it represents the adversarial noise causing deviation with respect to the linear dynamics. Our result subsumes a number of results in the distributed optimization literature. Finally, in a numerical experiment, we verify that our algorithm can be simply implemented for multi-agent tracking with nonlinear observations.|paper address track move target multi agent network target follow linear dynam corrupt adversari nois nois generat statist distribut locat target time induc global time vari loss function global loss sum local loss associ one agent agent noisi observ could nonlinear formul problem distribut onlin optim agent communic track minim global loss propos decentr version mirror descent algorithm provid non asymptot analysi problem use notion dynam regret measur perform algorithm versus offlin counterpart central set prove bound dynam regret scale invers network spectral gap repres adversari nois caus deviat respect linear dynam result subsum number result distribut optim literatur final numer experi verifi algorithm simpli implement multi agent track nonlinear observ|['Shahin Shahrampour', 'Ali Jadbabaie']|['math.OC', 'cs.MA', 'stat.ML']

By combining agent-based simulations and adaptive dynamics we show that social learning can result in colonies of generalists or specialists, depending on ecological parameters. Agent-based simulations further show that learning dynamics play a crucial role in task allocation. In particular, introspective individual learning readily favours the emergence of specialists, while a process resembling task recruitment favours the emergence of generalists.|investig effect social interact task al locat use evolutionari game theori egt propos simpl task alloc game studi differ learn mechan give rise specialis non specialis coloni differ ecolog condit combin agent base simul adapt dynam show social learn result coloni generalist specialist depend ecolog paramet agent base simul show learn dynam play crucial role task alloc particular introspect individu learn readili favour emerg specialist process resembl task recruit favour emerg generalist|['Rui Chen', 'Garcia Julian', 'Meyer Bernd']|['q-bio.PE', 'cs.MA']

This work presents some effects of users' psychology in mean-field-type games. In addition to the traditional ""material"" payoff modelling, psychological patterns are introduced in order to better capture and understand behaviors that are observed in engineering practice or in experimental settings. The psychological payoff value depends upon choices, mean-field states, mean-field actions, empathy and beliefs. It is shown that the affective empathy enforces mean-field equilibrium payoff equity and improves fairness between the players. It establishes equilibrium systems for such interactive decision-making problems. Basic empathy concepts are illustrated in several important problems in engineering including resource sharing, packet collision minimization, energy markets, and forwarding in Device-to-Device communications. The work conducts also an experiment with 47 people who have to decide whether to cooperate or not. The basic Interpersonal Reactivity Index of empathy metrics were used to measure the empathy distribution of each participant. Android app called Empathizer is developed to analyze systematically the data obtained from the participants. The experimental results reveal that the dominated strategies of the classical game theory are not dominated any more when users' psychology is involved, and a significant level of cooperation is observed among the users who are positively partially empathetic."|mean field type game theori focus cognit plausibl model choic human anim machin robot softwar defin mobil devic strateg interact work present effect user psycholog mean field type game addit tradit materi payoff model psycholog pattern introduc order better captur understand behavior observ engin practic experiment set psycholog payoff valu depend upon choic mean field state mean field action empathi belief shown affect empathi enforc mean field equilibrium payoff equiti improv fair player establish equilibrium system interact decis make problem basic empathi concept illustr sever import problem engin includ resourc share packet collis minim energi market forward devic devic communic work conduct also experi peopl decid whether cooper basic interperson reactiv index empathi metric use measur empathi distribut particip android app call empath develop analyz systemat data obtain particip experiment result reveal domin strategi classic game theori domin ani user psycholog involv signific level cooper observ among user posit partial empathet|['Giulia Rossi', 'Alain Tcheukam', 'Hamidou Tembine']|['cs.GT', 'cs.MA']

The robots are initially randomly distributed and need to visit several target locations while minimizing the total travel time. A centralized rendezvous-based algorithm is proposed, under which all the robots first move towards a rendezvous position until communication paths are established between every pair of robots either directly or through intermediate peers, and then one robot is chosen as the leader to make a centralized task assignment for the other robots. Furthermore, we propose a decentralized algorithm based on a single-traveling-salesman tour, which does not require all the robots to be connected through communication. We investigate the variation of the quality of the assignment solutions as the level of information sharing increases and as the communication range grows, respectively. The proposed algorithms are compared with a centralized algorithm with shared global information and a decentralized greedy algorithm respectively.

This paper develops a motion strategy that allows robots to safely handle critical communication failures for such multi-robot architectures. For each robot, the proposed algorithm computes a time horizon over which collisions with other robots are guaranteed not to occur. These safe time horizons are included in the commands being transmitted to the individual robots. In the event of a communication failure, the robots execute the last received velocity commands for the corresponding safe time horizons leading to a provably safe open-loop motion strategy. The resulting algorithm is computationally effective and is agnostic to the task that the robots are performing. The efficacy of the strategy is verified in simulation as well as on a team of differential-drive mobile robots.|multi robot system central decis maker specifi movement individu robot communic failur sever impair perform system paper develop motion strategi allow robot safe handl critic communic failur multi robot architectur robot propos algorithm comput time horizon collis robot guarante occur safe time horizon includ command transmit individu robot event communic failur robot execut last receiv veloc command correspond safe time horizon lead provabl safe open loop motion strategi result algorithm comput effect agnost task robot perform efficaci strategi verifi simul well team differenti drive mobil robot|['Siddharth Mayya', 'Magnus Egerstedt']|['cs.MA', 'cs.RO']

On the other side, in case of the 2-dimensional grid, the only known gathering algorithms for robots with bounded viewing radius without compass, need to memorize a constant number of rounds and need flags.   In this paper we contribute the, to the best of our knowledge, first gathering algorithm on the grid, which works for anonymous, oblivious robots with bounded viewing range, without any further means of communication and without any memory.

Cooperativeness is a property that applies to policies, not elementary actions. We introduce sequential social dilemmas that share the mixed incentive structure of matrix game social dilemmas but also require agents to learn policies that implement their strategic intentions. We analyze the dynamics of policies learned by multiple self-interested independent learning agents, each using its own deep Q-network, on two Markov games we introduce here: 1. a fruit Gathering game and 2. a Wolfpack hunting game.

Here we propose an agent-based, network model to mimic the ranking behaviour of individuals and its possible repercussions in human society. The main ingredient of the model is the assumption that the relevant feature of social interactions is each individual's keenness to maximise his or her status relative to others. The social networks produced by the model are homophilous and assortative, as frequently observed in human communities and most of the network properties seem quite independent of its size. However, it is seen that for small number of agents the resulting network consists of disjoint weakly connected communities while being highly assortative and homophilic. On the other hand larger networks turn out to be more cohesive with larger communities but less homophilic. We find that the reason for these changes is that larger network size allows agents to use new strategies for maximizing their social status allowing for more diverse links between them.|human societi peopl willing compet strive better social status well envious perceiv way superior lead social structur intrins hierarch propos agent base network model mimic rank behaviour individu possibl repercuss human societi main ingredi model assumpt relev featur social interact individu keen maximis status relat social network produc model homophil assort frequent observ human communiti network properti seem quit independ size howev seen small number agent result network consist disjoint weak connect communiti high assort homophil hand larger network turn cohes larger communiti less homophil find reason chang larger network size allow agent use new strategi maxim social status allow divers link|['Jan E.

MobilEye sensors installed on buses in Ann Arbor, Michigan, collected data on 2,973 valid crossing events. A stochastic interaction model was then created using a multivariate Gaussian mixture model. This model allowed us to simulate the movements of pedestrians reacting to an oncoming vehicle when approaching unsignalized crossings, and to evaluate the passing strategies of automated vehicles.

Controllers in V-formation games utilize a new formulation of model-predictive control we call Adaptive-Horizon MPC (AMPC), giving them extraordinary power: we prove that under certain controllability assumptions, an AMPC controller is able to attain V-formation with probability 1.   We define several classes of attackers, including those that in one move can remove R birds from the flock, or introduce random displacement into flock dynamics. We consider both naive attackers, whose strategies are purely probabilistic, and AMPC-enabled attackers, putting them on par strategically with the controllers. While an AMPC-enabled controller is expected to win every game with probability 1, in practice, it is resource-constrained: its maximum prediction horizon and the maximum number of game execution steps are fixed. Under these conditions, an attacker has a much better chance of winning a V-formation game.   Our extensive performance evaluation of V-formation games uses statistical model checking to estimate the probability an attacker can thwart the controller. Our results show that for the bird-removal game with R = 1, the controller almost always wins (restores the flock to a V-formation). For R = 2, the game outcome critically depends on which two birds are removed. For the displacement game, our results again demonstrate that an intelligent attacker, i.e. one that uses AMPC in this case, significantly outperforms its naive counterpart that randomly executes its attack.|introduc concept format game control attack control goal maneuv plant simpl model flock dynam format goal attack prevent control control format game util new formul model predict control call adapt horizon mpc ampc give extraordinari power prove certain control assumpt ampc control abl attain format probabl defin sever class attack includ one move remov bird flock introduc random displac flock dynam consid naiv attack whose strategi pure probabilist ampc enabl attack put par strateg control ampc enabl control expect win everi game probabl practic resourc constrain maximum predict horizon maximum number game execut step fix condit attack much better chanc win format game extens perform evalu format game use statist model check estim probabl attack thwart control result show bird remov game control almost alway win restor flock format game outcom critic depend two bird remov displac game result demonstr intellig attack one use ampc case signific outperform naiv counterpart random execut attack|['Scott A.

ACT provides an empirically derived mathematical model of culturally shared sentiments as heuristic guides for human decision making. BayesACT, a variant on classical ACT, combines affective reasoning with cognitive (denotative or logical) reasoning as is traditionally found in AI. Bayes\-ACT allows for the creation of agents that are both emotionally guided and goal-directed. In this work, we simulate BayesACT agents in the Iterated Networked Prisoner's Dilemma (INPD), and we show four out of five known properties of human play in INPD are replicated by these socio-affective agents. In particular, we show how the observed human behaviours of network structure invariance, anti-correlation of cooperation and reward, and player type stratification are all clearly emergent properties of the networked BayesACT agents. We further show that decision hyteresis (Moody Conditional Cooperation) is replicated by BayesACT agents in over $2/3$ of the cases we have considered. In contrast, previously used imitation-based agents are only able to replicate one of the five properties. We discuss the implications of these findings in the development of human-agent societies.|affect control theori act power general sociolog model human affect interact act provid empir deriv mathemat model cultur share sentiment heurist guid human decis make bayesact variant classic act combin affect reason cognit denot logic reason tradit found ai bay act allow creation agent emot guid goal direct work simul bayesact agent iter network prison dilemma inpd show four five known properti human play inpd replic socio affect agent particular show observ human behaviour network structur invari anti correl cooper reward player type stratif clear emerg properti network bayesact agent show decis hyteresi moodi condit cooper replic bayesact agent case consid contrast previous use imit base agent onli abl replic one five properti discuss implic find develop human agent societi|['Joshua D.

We model the communication network of a cyber-physical system as a sensor network which involves one single Gaussian source observed by many sensors, subject to additive independent Gaussian observation noises. The sensors communicate with the estimator over a coherent Gaussian multiple access channel. The aim of the receiver is to reconstruct the underlying source with minimum mean squared error. The scenario of interest here is one where some of the sensors are captured by the attacker and they act as the adversary (jammer): they strive to maximize distortion. The receiver (estimator) knows the captured sensors but still cannot simply ignore them due to the multiple access channel, i.e., the outputs of all sensors are summed to generate the estimator input.

This paper shows that this challenge can now be addressed by leveraging the recently introduced System Level Approach (SLA) to controller synthesis. In particular, in the context of the SLA, we define suitable notions of separability for control objective functions and system constraints such that the global optimization problem (or iterate update problems of a distributed optimization algorithm) can be decomposed into parallel subproblems. We then further show that if additional locality (i.e., sparsity) constraints are imposed, then these subproblems can be solved using local models and local decision variables. The SLA is essential to maintaining the convexity of the aforementioned problems under locality constraints. As a consequence, the resulting synthesis methods have $O(1)$ complexity relative to the size of the global system. We further show that many optimal control problems of interest, such as (localized) LQR and LQG, $\mathcal{H}_2$ optimal control with joint actuator and sensor regularization, and (localized) mixed $\mathcal{H}_2/\mathcal{L}_1$ optimal control problems, satisfy these notions of separability, and use these problems to explore tradeoffs in performance, actuator and sensing density, and average versus worst-case performance for a large-scale power inspired system.|major challeng face design larg scale cyber physic system power system internet thing intellig transport system tradit distribut optim control method scale grace neither control synthesi control implement system compos million billion even trillion interact subsystem paper show challeng address leverag recent introduc system level approach sla control synthesi particular context sla defin suitabl notion separ control object function system constraint global optim problem iter updat problem distribut optim algorithm decompos parallel subproblem show addit local sparsiti constraint impos subproblem solv use local model local decis variabl sla essenti maintain convex aforement problem local constraint consequ result synthesi method complex relat size global system show mani optim control problem interest local lqr lqg mathcal optim control joint actuat sensor regular local mix mathcal mathcal optim control problem satisfi notion separ use problem explor tradeoff perform actuat sens densiti averag versus worst case perform larg scale power inspir system|['Yuh-Shyang Wang', 'Nikolai Matni', 'John C.

The goal of the agent is to make a specific candidate either win (\emph{constructive} control) or lose (\emph{destructive} control) the election. We study the constructive and destructive voter control problems whenadding and deleting voters have a \emph{combinatorial flavor}: If we add (resp.\ delete) a voter~$v$, we also add (resp.\ delete) a bundle~$\kappa(v) $ of voters that are associated with~$v$. While the bundle~$\kappa(v)$ may have more than one voter, a voter may also be associated with more than one voter. We analyze the computational complexity of the four voter control problems for the Plurality rule. We obtain that, in general, making a candidate lose is computationally easier than making her win. In particular, if the bundling relation is symmetric (i.e.\ $\forall w\colon w \in \kappa(v) \Leftrightarrow v \in \kappa(w) $), and if each voter has at most two voters associated with him, then destructive control is polynomial-time solvable while the constructive variant remains $\NP$-hard. Even if the bundles are disjoint (i.e.\ $\forall w\colon w \in \kappa(v) \Leftrightarrow \kappa(v) = \kappa(w) $), the constructive problem variants remain intractable. Finally, the minimization variant of constructive control by adding voters does not admit an efficient approximation algorithm, unless P=NP.|voter control problem model situat extern agent tri toaffect result elect ad delet fewest number voter goal agent make specif candid either win emph construct control lose emph destruct control elect studi construct destruct voter control problem whenad delet voter emph combinatori flavor add resp delet voter also add resp delet bundl kappa voter associ bundl kappa may one voter voter may also associ one voter analyz comput complex four voter control problem plural rule obtain general make candid lose comput easier make win particular bundl relat symmetr foral colon kappa leftrightarrow kappa voter two voter associ destruct control polynomi time solvabl construct variant remain np hard even bundl disjoint foral colon kappa leftrightarrow kappa kappa construct problem variant remain intract final minim variant construct control ad voter doe admit effici approxim algorithm unless np|['Leon Kellerhals', 'Viatcheslav Korenwein', 'Philipp Zschoche', 'Robert Bredereck', 'Jiehua Chen']|['cs.MA']

To reduce the amount of required communication, we develop a self-triggered algorithm that allows agents to communicate with the cloud only when necessary rather than at some fixed period. Unlike the vast majority of similar works that propose distributed event- and/or self-triggered control laws, this work doesn't assume agents can be ""listening"" continuously. In other words, when an event is triggered by one agent, neighboring agents will not be aware of this until the next time they establish communication with the cloud themselves. Using a notion of ""promises"" about future control inputs, agents are able to keep track of higher quality estimates about their neighbors allowing them to stay disconnected from the cloud for longer periods of time while still guaranteeing a positive contribution to the global task. We show that our self-triggered coordination algorithm guarantees that the system asymptotically reaches the set of desired states.

Thus, it motivates us to leverage the distributed constraint optimization problem (DCOP), a framework of modeling MAS, to solve the user association problem in heterogeneous networks (HetNets). Two issues we have to consider when we take DCOP into the application of HetNet including: (i) How to set up an effective model by DCOP taking account of the negtive impact of the increment of users on the modeling process (ii) Which kind of algorithms is more suitable to balance the time consumption and the quality of soltuion. Aiming to overcome these issues, we firstly come up with an ECAV-$\eta$ (Each Connection As Variable) model in which a parameter $\eta$ with an adequate assignment ($\eta=3$ in this paper) is able to control the scale of the model. After that, a Markov chain (MC) based algorithm is proposed on the basis of log-sum-exp function. Experimental results show that the solution obtained by DCOP framework is better than the one obtained by the Max-SINR algorithm. Comparing with the Lagrange dual decomposition based method (LDD), the solution performance has been improved since there is no need to transform original problem into a satisfied one. In addition, it is also apparent that the DCOP based method has better robustness than LDD when the number of users increases but the available resource at base stations are limited.|multi agent system mas abl character behavior individu agent interact agent thus motiv us leverag distribut constraint optim problem dcop framework model mas solv user associ problem heterogen network hetnet two issu consid take dcop applic hetnet includ set effect model dcop take account negtiv impact increment user model process ii kind algorithm suitabl balanc time consumpt qualiti soltuion aim overcom issu first come ecav eta connect variabl model paramet eta adequ assign eta paper abl control scale model markov chain mc base algorithm propos basi log sum exp function experiment result show solut obtain dcop framework better one obtain max sinr algorithm compar lagrang dual decomposit base method ldd solut perform improv sinc need transform origin problem satisfi one addit also appar dcop base method better robust ldd number user increas avail resourc base station limit|['Peibo Duan', 'Guoqiang Mao', 'Changsheng Zhang', 'Bin Zhang']|['cs.MA']

We are inspired by the conduciveness of Tullock contests to attracting user entry (yet not necessarily a higher revenue) in other domains. In this paper, we explore a new dimension in optimal Tullock contest design, by superseding the contest prize---which is fixed in conventional Tullock contests---with a prize function that is dependent on the (unknown) winner's contribution, in order to maximize the crowdsourcer's utility. We show that this approach leads to attractive practical advantages: (a) it is well-suited for rapid prototyping in fully distributed web agents and smartphone apps; (b) it overcomes the disincentive to participate caused by players' antagonism to an increasing number of rivals. Furthermore, we optimize conventional, fixed-prize Tullock contests to construct the most superior benchmark to compare against our mechanism. Through extensive evaluations, we show that our mechanism significantly outperforms the optimal benchmark, by over three folds on the crowdsourcer's utility cum profit and up to nine folds on the players' social welfare.|incent mechan crowdsourc extens studi framework pay auction along distinct line paper propos use tullock contest altern tool design incent mechan crowdsourc inspir conduc tullock contest attract user entri yet necessarili higher revenu domain paper explor new dimens optim tullock contest design supersed contest prize fix convent tullock contest prize function depend unknown winner contribut order maxim crowdsourc util show approach lead attract practic advantag well suit rapid prototyp fulli distribut web agent smartphon app overcom disincent particip caus player antagon increas number rival furthermor optim convent fix prize tullock contest construct superior benchmark compar mechan extens evalu show mechan signific outperform optim benchmark three fold crowdsourc util cum profit nine fold player social welfar|['T.

We follow this idea and propose a game-based model of cohesion that not only relies on the social network, but also reflects individuals' social needs. In particular, our model is a type of cooperative games where players may gain popularity by strategically forming groups. A group is socially cohesive if the grand coalition is core stable. We study social cohesion in some special types of graphs and draw a link between social cohesion and the classical notion of structural cohesion. We then focus on the problem of deciding whether a given social network is socially cohesive and show that this problem is CoNP-complete.

We show how liquid democracy on binary issues can be embedded into the framework of binary aggregation with abstentions, enabling the transfer of known results about the latter---such as impossibility theorems---to the former. This embedding also sheds light on the relation between delegation cycles in liquid democracy and the probability of collective abstentions, as well as the issue of individual rationality in a delegable proxy voting setting. We then show how liquid democracy on binary issues can be modeled and analyzed also as a specific process of dynamics of binary opinions on networks. These processes---called Boolean DeGroot processes---are a special case of the DeGroot stochastic model of opinion diffusion. We establish the convergence conditions of such processes and show they provide some novel insights on how the effects of delegation cycles and individual rationality could be mitigated within liquid democracy.   The study is a first attempt to provide theoretical foundations to the delgable proxy features of the liquid democracy voting system. Our analysis suggests recommendations on how the system may be modified to make it more resilient with respect to the handling of delegation cycles and of inconsistent majorities.|paper propos analysi liquid democraci deleg proxi vote perspect binari aggreg binari diffus model show liquid democraci binari issu embed framework binari aggreg abstent enabl transfer known result latter imposs theorem former embed also shed light relat deleg cycl liquid democraci probabl collect abstent well issu individu ration deleg proxi vote set show liquid democraci binari issu model analyz also specif process dynam binari opinion network process call boolean degroot process special case degroot stochast model opinion diffus establish converg condit process show provid novel insight effect deleg cycl individu ration could mitig within liquid democraci studi first attempt provid theoret foundat delgabl proxi featur liquid democraci vote system analysi suggest recommend system may modifi make resili respect handl deleg cycl inconsist major|['Zoé Christoff', 'Davide Grossi']|['cs.MA', 'cs.AI', 'cs.SI']

This passive learning is problematic if we are interested in developing interactive machines, such as conversational agents. We propose a framework for language learning that relies on multi-agent communication. We study this learning in the context of referential games. In these games, a sender and a receiver see a pair of images. The sender is told one of them is the target and is allowed to send a message from a fixed, arbitrary vocabulary to the receiver. The receiver must rely on this message to identify the target. Thus, the agents develop their own language interactively out of the need to communicate. We show that two networks with simple configurations are able to learn to coordinate in the referential game. We further explore how to make changes to the game environment to cause the ""word meanings"" induced in the game to better reflect intuitive semantic properties of the images. In addition, we present a simple strategy for grounding the agents' code into natural language. Both of these are necessary steps towards developing machines that are able to communicate with humans productively."|current mainstream approach train natur languag system expos larg amount text passiv learn problemat interest develop interact machin convers agent propos framework languag learn reli multi agent communic studi learn context referenti game game sender receiv see pair imag sender told one target allow send messag fix arbitrari vocabulari receiv receiv must reli messag identifi target thus agent develop languag interact need communic show two network simpl configur abl learn coordin referenti game explor make chang game environ caus word mean induc game better reflect intuit semant properti imag addit present simpl strategi ground agent code natur languag necessari step toward develop machin abl communic human product|['Angeliki Lazaridou', 'Alexander Peysakhovich', 'Marco Baroni']|['cs.CL', 'cs.CV', 'cs.GT', 'cs.LG', 'cs.MA']

ARES uses Particle Swarm Optimization, with adaptive sizing for both the receding horizon and the particle swarm. Inspired by Importance Splitting, the length of the horizon and the number of particles are chosen such that at least one particle reaches a next-level state, that is, a state where the cost decreases by a required delta from the previous-level state. The level relation on states and the plans constructed by ARES implicitly define a Lyapunov function and an optimal policy, respectively, both of which could be explicitly generated by applying ARES to all states of the MDP, up to some topological equivalence relation. We also assess the effectiveness of ARES by statistically evaluating its rate of success in generating optimal plans. The ARES algorithm resulted from our desire to clarify if flying in V-formation is a flocking policy that optimizes energy conservation, clear view, and velocity alignment. That is, we were interested to see if one could find optimal plans that bring a flock from an arbitrary initial state to a state exhibiting a single connected V-formation. For flocks with 7 birds, ARES is able to generate a plan that leads to a V-formation in 95% of the 8,000 random initial configurations within 63 seconds, on average. ARES can also be easily customized into a model-predictive controller (MPC) with an adaptive receding horizon and statistical guarantees of convergence. To the best of our knowledge, our adaptive-sizing approach is the first to provide convergence guarantees in receding-horizon techniques.|introduc effici approxim algorithm generat optim plan action sequenc take initi state markov decis process mdp state whose cost specifi converg threshold use particl swarm optim adapt size reced horizon particl swarm inspir import split length horizon number particl chosen least one particl reach next level state state cost decreas requir delta previous level state level relat state plan construct implicit defin lyapunov function optim polici respect could explicit generat appli state mdp topolog equival relat also assess effect statist evalu rate success generat optim plan algorithm result desir clarifi fli format flock polici optim energi conserv clear view veloc align interest see one could find optim plan bring flock arbitrari initi state state exhibit singl connect format flock bird abl generat plan lead format random initi configur within second averag also easili custom model predict control mpc adapt reced horizon statist guarante converg best knowledg adapt size approach first provid converg guarante reced horizon techniqu|['Anna Lukina', 'Lukas Esterle', 'Christian Hirsch', 'Ezio Bartocci', 'Junxing Yang', 'Ashish Tiwari', 'Scott A.

Each of the teams is given the same number of targets as there are agents in the team. Each agent has to move to exactly one target given to its team such that all targets are visited. The TAPF problem is to first assign agents to targets and then plan collision-free paths for the agents to their targets in a way such that the makespan is minimized. We present the CBM (Conflict-Based Min-Cost-Flow) algorithm, a hierarchical algorithm that solves TAPF instances optimally by combining ideas from anonymous and non-anonymous multi-agent path-finding algorithms. On the low level, CBM uses a min-cost max-flow algorithm on a time-expanded network to assign all agents in a single team to targets and plan their paths. On the high level, CBM uses conflict-based search to resolve collisions among agents in different teams. Theoretically, we prove that CBM is correct, complete and optimal. Experimentally, we show the scalability of CBM to TAPF instances with dozens of teams and hundreds of agents and adapt it to a simulated warehouse system.|studi tapf combin target assign path find problem team agent known terrain general anonym non anonym multi agent path find problem team given number target agent team agent move exact one target given team target visit tapf problem first assign agent target plan collis free path agent target way makespan minim present cbm conflict base min cost flow algorithm hierarch algorithm solv tapf instanc optim combin idea anonym non anonym multi agent path find algorithm low level cbm use min cost max flow algorithm time expand network assign agent singl team target plan path high level cbm use conflict base search resolv collis among agent differ team theoret prove cbm correct complet optim experiment show scalabl cbm tapf instanc dozen team hundr agent adapt simul warehous system|['Hang Ma', 'Sven Koenig']|['cs.AI', 'cs.MA', 'cs.RO']

We consider the regularization protocol that amounts to the addition of a dummy agent (hub) uniformly connected to the agents. The presence of such a hub guarantees the achievement of an asymptotic consensus. For the ""evaporation"" of the dummy agent, the strength of its influences on the other agents vanishes, which leads to the concept of latent consensus. We obtain a closed-form expression for the consensus when the connections of the hub are symmetric, in this case, the impact of the hub upon the consensus remains fixed. On the other hand, if the hub is essentially influenced by the agents, whereas its influence on them tends to zero, then the consensus is expressed by the scalar product of the vector of column means of the Laplacian eigenprojection of $\Gamma$ and the initial state vector of the system. Another protocol, which assumes the presence of vanishingly weak uniform background links between the agents, leads to the same latent consensus."|paper studi problem achiev consensus multi agent system case depend digraph gamma span tree consid regular protocol amount addit dummi agent hub uniform connect agent presenc hub guarante achiev asymptot consensus evapor dummi agent strength influenc agent vanish lead concept latent consensus obtain close form express consensus connect hub symmetr case impact hub upon consensus remain fix hand hub essenti influenc agent wherea influenc tend zero consensus express scalar product vector column mean laplacian eigenproject gamma initi state vector system anoth protocol assum presenc vanish weak uniform background link agent lead latent consensus|['Rafig Agaev', 'Pavel Chebotarev']|['math.OC', 'cs.MA', 'cs.SY', '93A14, 68T42, 15B51, 05C50, 05C05, 60J22']

In this paper, we focus on a special case of coalition formation known as Graph-Constrained Coalition Formation (GCCF) whereby a network connecting the agents constrains the formation of coalitions. We focus on this type of problem given that in many real-world applications, agents may be connected by a communication network or only trust certain peers in their social network. We propose a novel representation of this problem based on the concept of edge contraction, which allows us to model the search space induced by the GCCF problem as a rooted tree. Then, we propose an anytime solution algorithm (CFSS), which is particularly efficient when applied to a general class of characteristic functions called $m+a$ functions. Moreover, we show how CFSS can be efficiently parallelised to solve GCCF using a non-redundant partition of the search space. We benchmark CFSS on both synthetic and realistic scenarios, using a real-world dataset consisting of the energy consumption of a large number of households in the UK. Our results show that, in the best case, the serial version of CFSS is 4 orders of magnitude faster than the state of the art, while the parallel version is 9.44 times faster than the serial version on a 12-core machine. Moreover, CFSS is the first approach to provide anytime approximate solutions with quality guarantees for very large systems of agents (i.e., with more than 2700 agents).|coalit format typic involv come togeth multipl heterogen agent achiev individu collect goal paper focus special case coalit format known graph constrain coalit format gccf wherebi network connect agent constrain format coalit focus type problem given mani real world applic agent may connect communic network onli trust certain peer social network propos novel represent problem base concept edg contract allow us model search space induc gccf problem root tree propos anytim solut algorithm cfss particular effici appli general class characterist function call function moreov show cfss effici parallelis solv gccf use non redund partit search space benchmark cfss synthet realist scenario use real world dataset consist energi consumpt larg number household uk result show best case serial version cfss order magnitud faster state art parallel version time faster serial version core machin moreov cfss first approach provid anytim approxim solut qualiti guarante veri larg system agent agent|['Filippo Bistaffa', 'Alessandro Farinelli', 'Jesús Cerquides', 'Juan A.

Vagueness is represented by a third truth state meaning \emph{borderline}. This is combined with a probabilistic model of uncertainty. A belief combination operator is then proposed which exploits borderline truth values to enable agents with conflicting beliefs to reach a compromise. A number of simulation experiments are carried out in which agents apply this operator in pairwise interactions, under the bounded confidence restriction that the two agents' beliefs must be sufficiently consistent with each other before agreement can be reached. As well as studying the consensus operator in isolation we also investigate scenarios in which agents are influenced either directly or indirectly by the state of the world. For the former we conduct simulations which combine consensus formation with belief updating based on evidence. For the latter we investigate the effect of assuming that the closer an agent's beliefs are to the truth the more visible they are in the consensus building process. In all cases applying the consensus operators results in the population converging to a single shared belief which is both crisp and certain. Furthermore, simulations which combine consensus formation with evidential updating converge faster to a shared opinion which is closer to the actual state of the world than those in which beliefs are only changed as a result of directly receiving new evidence. Finally, if agent interactions are guided by belief quality measured as similarity to the true state of the world, then applying the consensus operator alone results in the population converging to a high quality shared belief.|consensus format investig multi agent system agent belief vagu uncertain vagu repres third truth state mean emph borderlin combin probabilist model uncertainti belief combin oper propos exploit borderlin truth valu enabl agent conflict belief reach compromis number simul experi carri agent appli oper pairwis interact bound confid restrict two agent belief must suffici consist befor agreement reach well studi consensus oper isol also investig scenario agent influenc either direct indirect state world former conduct simul combin consensus format belief updat base evid latter investig effect assum closer agent belief truth visibl consensus build process case appli consensus oper result popul converg singl share belief crisp certain furthermor simul combin consensus format evidenti updat converg faster share opinion closer actual state world belief onli chang result direct receiv new evid final agent interact guid belief qualiti measur similar true state world appli consensus oper alon result popul converg high qualiti share belief|['Michael Crosscombe', 'Jonathan Lawry']|['cs.MA', 'cs.AI']

The complexity results range from NP-completeness to undecidability, depending on the precise setup of the problem. No less importantly, fixpoint equivalences do not generally hold for imperfect information strategies, which seriously hampers incremental synthesis of winning strategies. In this paper, we propose translations of ATLir formulae that provide lower and upper bounds for their truth values, and are cheaper to verify than the original specifications. That is, if the expression is verified as true then the corresponding formula of ATLir should also hold in the given model. We begin by showing where the straightforward approach does not work. Then, we propose how it can be modified to obtain guaranteed lower bounds. To this end, we alter the next-step operator in such a way that traversing one's indistinguishability relation is seen as atomic activity. Most interestingly, the lower approximation is provided by a fixpoint expression that uses a nonstandard variant of the next-step ability operator.

As failure and/or inadequacy in traffic safety system are life-critical, such collisions must be detected and resolved in an efficient way to manage continuously rising traffic. In this paper, we address different types of collision scenarios along with their early detection and resolution techniques in a complex railway system. In order to handle collisions dynamically in distributed manner, a novel agent based solution approach is proposed using the idea of max-sum algorithm, where each agent (train agent, station agent, and junction agent) communicates and cooperates with others to generate a good feasible solution that keeps the system in a safe state, i.e., collision free. We implement the proposed mechanism in Java Agent DEvelopment Framework (JADE). The results are evaluated with exhaustive experiments and compared with different existing collision handling methods to show the efficiency of our proposed approach.|advanc intellig transport system complex oper requir autonom plan manag avoid collis day day traffic failur inadequaci traffic safeti system life critic collis must detect resolv effici way manag continu rise traffic paper address differ type collis scenario along earli detect resolut techniqu complex railway system order handl collis dynam distribut manner novel agent base solut approach propos use idea max sum algorithm agent train agent station agent junction agent communic cooper generat good feasibl solut keep system safe state collis free implement propos mechan java agent develop framework jade result evalu exhaust experi compar differ exist collis handl method show effici propos approach|['Poulami Dalapati', 'Abhijeet Padhy', 'Bhawana Mishra', 'Animesh Dutta', 'Swapan Bhattacharya']|['cs.MA']

A common feature is that different champion teams succeeded in finding a way to decompose the enormous search-space of possible single- and multi-agent behaviours, by automating the exploration of the problem space with various techniques which accelerated the software development efforts. These methods included interactive debugging, machine learning, automated planning, and opponent modelling.

An alternate approach is to use a swarm of simple robots that work together, rather than a single highly capable robot. The central-place foraging algorithm (CPFA) is effective for coordinating robot swarm search and collection tasks. Robots start at a centrally placed location (nest), explore potential targets in the area without global localization or central control, and return the targets to the nest. The scalability of the CPFA is limited because large numbers of robots produce more inter-robot collisions and large search areas result in substantial travel costs. We address these problems with the multiple-place foraging algorithm (MPFA), which uses multiple nests distributed throughout the search area. Robots start from a randomly assigned home nest but return to the closest nest with found targets. We simulate the foraging behavior of robot swarms in the robot simulator ARGoS and employ a genetic algorithm to discover different optimized foraging strategies as swarm sizes and the number of targets are scaled up. In our experiments, the MPFA always produces higher foraging rates, fewer collisions, and lower travel and search time compared to the CPFA for the partially clustered targets distribution. The main contribution of this paper is that we systematically quantify the advantages of the MPFA (reduced travel time and collisions), the potential disadvantages (less communication among robots), and the ability of a genetic algorithm to tune MPFA parameters to mitigate search inefficiency due to less communication.|individu robot effect explor larg unmap area altern approach use swarm simpl robot work togeth rather singl high capabl robot central place forag algorithm cpfa effect coordin robot swarm search collect task robot start central place locat nest explor potenti target area without global local central control return target nest scalabl cpfa limit becaus larg number robot produc inter robot collis larg search area result substanti travel cost address problem multipl place forag algorithm mpfa use multipl nest distribut throughout search area robot start random assign home nest return closest nest found target simul forag behavior robot swarm robot simul argo employ genet algorithm discov differ optim forag strategi swarm size number target scale experi mpfa alway produc higher forag rate fewer collis lower travel search time compar cpfa partial cluster target distribut main contribut paper systemat quantifi advantag mpfa reduc travel time collis potenti disadvantag less communic among robot abil genet algorithm tune mpfa paramet mitig search ineffici due less communic|['Qi Lu', 'Melanie E.

The algorithm runs over a network in which the agents communicate with their neighbors and perform local computation. In the proposed algorithm, each agent can compute and communicate independently at different times, for different durations, with the information it has even if the latest information from its neighbors is not yet available. Such an asynchronous algorithm reduces the time that agents would otherwise waste idle because of communication delays or because their neighbors are slower. It also eliminates the need for a global clock for synchronization. Mathematically, the algorithm involves both primal and dual variables, uses fixed step-size parameters, and provably converges to the exact solution under a bounded delay assumption and a random agent assumption. When running synchronously, the algorithm performs just as well as existing competitive synchronous algorithms such as PG-EXTRA, which diverges without synchronization. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical findings and illustrate the performance of the proposed algorithm.|propos asynchron decentr algorithm consensus optim algorithm run network agent communic neighbor perform local comput propos algorithm agent comput communic independ differ time differ durat inform even latest inform neighbor yet avail asynchron algorithm reduc time agent would otherwis wast idl becaus communic delay becaus neighbor slower also elimin need global clock synchron mathemat algorithm involv primal dual variabl use fix step size paramet provabl converg exact solut bound delay assumpt random agent assumpt run synchron algorithm perform well exist competit synchron algorithm pg extra diverg without synchron numer experi confirm theoret find illustr perform propos algorithm|['Tianyu Wu', 'Kun Yuan', 'Qing Ling', 'Wotao Yin', 'Ali H.

We show theoretically that this space is convex. Then among the possible parliaments we present an algorithm to produce the most majoritarian result. We then test the system and compare the results with a pure proportional and a majoritarian voting system showing how the results are comparable with the majoritarian system. Then we simulate the system and show how it tends to produce parties of exponentially decreasing size with always a first, major party. Finally we describe how the system can be used in a context of a parliament made up of two separate houses.|present altern vote system aim bridg gap proport repres system majoritarian singl winner elect system system let peopl vote multipl parti assign ballot singl parti open whole rang possibl system repres show theoret space convex among possibl parliament present algorithm produc majoritarian result test system compar result pure proport majoritarian vote system show result compar majoritarian system simul system show tend produc parti exponenti decreas size alway first major parti final describ system use context parliament made two separ hous|['Pietro Speroni di Fenizio', 'Daniele A.

The problem of preservation of structural controllability under simultaneous failures in both the communication links and the agents is investigated. The effects of the loss of agents and communication links on the controllability of an information flow graph are previously studied. In this work, the corresponding results are exploited to introduce some useful indices and importance measures that help characterize and quantify the role of individual links and agents in the controllability of the overall network. Existing results are then extended by considering the effects of losses in both links and agents at the same time. To this end, the concepts of joint (r,s)-controllability and joint t-controllability are introduced as quantitative measures of reliability for a multi-agent system, and their important properties are investigated. Lastly, the class of jointly critical digraphs is introduced and it is stated that if a digraph is jointly critical, then joint t-controllability is a necessary and sufficient condition for remaining controllable following the failure of any set of links and agents, with cardinality less than t. Various examples are exploited throughout the paper to elaborate on the analytical findings.|paper structur control leader follow multi agent system multipl leader studi graph theoret point view problem preserv structur control simultan failur communic link agent investig effect loss agent communic link control inform flow graph previous studi work correspond result exploit introduc use indic import measur help character quantifi role individu link agent control overal network exist result extend consid effect loss link agent time end concept joint control joint control introduc quantit measur reliabl multi agent system import properti investig last class joint critic digraph introduc state digraph joint critic joint control necessari suffici condit remain control follow failur ani set link agent cardin less various exampl exploit throughout paper elabor analyt find|['M.

Given a fixed observation point, it is desired to find sufficient graphical conditions under which the failure of a set of edges in the network information flow digraph is distinguishable from another set. When the latter is empty, this corresponds to the detectability of the former link set given the response of the observing agent. In developing the results, a powerful extension of the all-minors matrix tree theorem in algebraic graph theory is proved which relates the minors of the transformed Laplacian of a directed graph to the number and length of the shortest paths between its vertices. The results reveal an intricate relationship between the ability to distinguish the responses of a healthy and a faulty multi-agent network and the inter-nodal paths in their information flow digraphs. The results have direct implications for the operation and design of multi-agent systems subject to multiple link losses.

Though the succinct representation may be exponentially smaller than the nonsuccinct representation, we find only one natural case where the complexity increases, namely the complexity of winner determination for Kemeny elections. This is in sharp contrast to the case where each voter has a weight, where the complexity usually increases.|comput studi elect general assum prefer elector come list vote depend context may much natur repres list succinct distinct vote elector count consid succinct represent voter affect comput complex elect problem though succinct represent may exponenti smaller nonsuccinct represent find onli one natur case complex increas name complex winner determin kemeni elect sharp contrast case voter weight complex usual increas|['Zack Fitzsimmons', 'Edith Hemaspaandra']|['cs.GT', 'cs.CC', 'cs.MA']

Although this problem has been studied in the past, there has not been a method that guarantees both goal satisfaction and safety for vehicles with general nonlinear dynamics while taking into account disturbances and potential adversarial agents, to the best of our knowledge. Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability is the ideal tool for guaranteeing goal satisfaction and safety under such scenarios, and has been successfully applied to many small-scale problems. However, a direct application of HJ reachability in most cases becomes intractable when there are more than two vehicles due to the exponentially scaling computational complexity with respect to system dimension. In this paper, we take advantage of the guarantees HJ reachability provides, and eliminate the computation burden by assigning a strict priority ordering to the vehicles under consideration. Under this sequential path planning (SPP) scheme, vehicles reserve ""space-time"" portions in the airspace, and the space-time portions guarantee dynamic feasibility, collision avoidance, and optimality of the paths given the priority ordering. With a computation complexity that scales quadratically when accounting for both disturbances and an intruder, and linearly when accounting for only disturbances, SPP can tractably solve the multi-vehicle path planning problem for vehicles with general nonlinear dynamics in a practical setting. We demonstrate our theory in representative simulations."|provabl safe scalabl multi vehicl path plan import urgent problem due expect increas autom civilian airspac near futur although problem studi past method guarante goal satisfact safeti vehicl general nonlinear dynam take account disturb potenti adversari agent best knowledg hamilton jacobi hj reachabl ideal tool guarante goal satisfact safeti scenario success appli mani small scale problem howev direct applic hj reachabl case becom intract two vehicl due exponenti scale comput complex respect system dimens paper take advantag guarante hj reachabl provid elimin comput burden assign strict prioriti order vehicl consider sequenti path plan spp scheme vehicl reserv space time portion airspac space time portion guarante dynam feasibl collis avoid optim path given prioriti order comput complex scale quadrat account disturb intrud linear account onli disturb spp tractabl solv multi vehicl path plan problem vehicl general nonlinear dynam practic set demonstr theori repres simul|['Mo Chen', 'Somil Bansal', 'Jaime F.
