We propose to use a pretrained convnet feature, a concatenated feature vector using activations of feature maps of multiple layers in a trained convolutional network. We show that how this convnet feature can serve as a general-purpose music representation. In the experiment, a convnet is trained for music tagging and then transferred for many music-related classification and regression tasks as well as an audio-related classification task. In experiments, the convnet feature outperforms the baseline MFCC feature in all tasks and many reported approaches of aggregating MFCCs and low- and high-level music features.|paper present transfer learn approach music classif regress task propos use pretrain convnet featur concaten featur vector use activ featur map multipl layer train convolut network show convnet featur serv general purpos music represent experi convnet train music tag transfer mani music relat classif regress task well audio relat classif task experi convnet featur outperform baselin mfcc featur task mani report approach aggreg mfccs low high level music featur|['Keunwoo Choi', 'György Fazekas', 'Mark Sandler', 'Kyunghyun Cho']|['cs.CV', 'cs.AI', 'cs.MM', 'cs.SD']

An inner time series contains information that does not depend on the nature of the sensors, which the observer chose to monitor the system. Instead, it encodes information that is intrinsic to the evolution of the observed system. Because of its sensor-independence, an inner time series may produce fewer false negatives when it is used to detect events in the presence of sensor drift. Furthermore, if the observed physical system is comprised of non-interacting subsystems, its inner time series is separable; i.e., it consists of a collection of time series, each one being the inner time series of an isolated subsystem. Because of this property, an inner time series can be used to detect a specific behavior of one of the independent subsystems without using blind source separation to disentangle that subsystem from the others. The method is illustrated by applying it to: 1) an analytic example; 2) the audio waveform of one speaker; 3) video images from a moving camera; 4) mixtures of audio waveforms of two speakers.|paper show time seri measur evolv system process creat inner time seri unaffect ani instantan invert possibl nonlinear transform measur inner time seri contain inform doe depend natur sensor observ chose monitor system instead encod inform intrins evolut observ system becaus sensor independ inner time seri may produc fewer fals negat use detect event presenc sensor drift furthermor observ physic system compris non interact subsystem inner time seri separ consist collect time seri one inner time seri isol subsystem becaus properti inner time seri use detect specif behavior one independ subsystem without use blind sourc separ disentangl subsystem method illustr appli analyt exampl audio waveform one speaker video imag move camera mixtur audio waveform two speaker|['David N.

Because performed note durations can deviate largely from score-indicated values, previous methods had the problem of not being able to accurately estimate offset score times (or note values) and thus could only output incomplete musical scores. Based on observations that the pitch context and onset score times are influential on the configuration of note values, we construct a context-tree model that provides prior distributions of note values using these features and combine it with a performance model in the framework of Markov random fields. Evaluation results showed that our method reduces the average error rate by around 40 percent compared to existing/simple methods. We also confirmed that, in our model, the score model plays a more important role than the performance model, and it automatically captures the voice structure by unsupervised learning.|paper present statist method music transcript estim score time note onset offset polyphon midi perform signal becaus perform note durat deviat larg score indic valu previous method problem abl accur estim offset score time note valu thus could onli output incomplet music score base observ pitch context onset score time influenti configur note valu construct context tree model provid prior distribut note valu use featur combin perform model framework markov random field evalu result show method reduc averag error rate around percent compar exist simpl method also confirm model score model play import role perform model automat captur voic structur unsupervis learn|['Eita Nakamura', 'Kazuyoshi Yoshii', 'Simon Dixon']|['cs.AI', 'cs.SD']

In this paper, we develop an audio classification system that classifies an audio stream into music, speech, speech+music, and noise, adaptably depending on driving environments including highway, local road, crowded city, and stopped vehicle. More than 420 minutes of audio data including various genres of music, speech, speech+music, and noise are collected from diverse driving environments.

A Neurocognitive Physics Study with EEG|gestalt phenomenon music neurocognit physic studi eeg|The term gestalt has been widely used in the field of psychology which defined the perception of human mind to group any object not in part but as a unified whole. Music in general is polytonic i.e. a combination of a number of pure tones (frequencies) mixed together in a manner that sounds harmonius. The study of human brain response due to different frequency groups of acoustic signal can give us an excellent insight regarding the neural and functional architecture of brain functions. In this work we have tried to analyze the effect of different frequency bands of music on the various frequency rhythms of human brain obtained from EEG data of 5 participants. Four (4) widely popular Rabindrasangeet clips were subjected to Wavelet Transform method for extracting five resonant frequency bands from the original music signal. These resonant frequency bands were presented to the subjects as auditory stimulus and EEG signals recorded simultaneously in 19 different locations of the brain. The recorded EEG signals were noise cleaned and subjected to Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (MFDFA) technique on the alpha, theta and gamma frequency range. Thus, we obtained the complexity values (in the form of multifractal spectral width) in alpha, theta and gamma EEG rhythms corresponding to different frequency bands of music. We obtain frequency specific arousal based response in different lobes of brain as well as in specific EEG bands corresponding to musical stimuli. This revelation can be of immense importance when it comes to the field of cognitive music therapy.|term gestalt wide use field psycholog defin percept human mind group ani object part unifi whole music general polyton combin number pure tone frequenc mix togeth manner sound harmonius studi human brain respons due differ frequenc group acoust signal give us excel insight regard neural function architectur brain function work tri analyz effect differ frequenc band music various frequenc rhythm human brain obtain eeg data particip four wide popular rabindrasangeet clip subject wavelet transform method extract five reson frequenc band origin music signal reson frequenc band present subject auditori stimulus eeg signal record simultan differ locat brain record eeg signal nois clean subject multifract detrend fluctuat analysi mfdfa techniqu alpha theta gamma frequenc rang thus obtain complex valu form multifract spectral width alpha theta gamma eeg rhythm correspond differ frequenc band music obtain frequenc specif arous base respons differ lobe brain well specif eeg band correspond music stimuli revel immens import come field cognit music therapi|['Shankha Sanyal', 'Archi Banerjee', 'Souparno Roy', 'Sourya Sengupta', 'Sayan Biswas', 'Sayan Nag', 'Ranjan Sengupta', 'Dipak Ghosh']|['cs.SD', 'q-bio.NC']

In this paper we propose a novel technique for attacking this problem. The core of our technique is permutation invariant training (PIT), which aims at minimizing the source stream reconstruction error no matter how labels are ordered. This is achieved by aligning labels to the output streams automatically during the training time. This strategy effectively solves the label permutation problem observed in deep learning based techniques for speech separation. More interestingly, our approach can integrate speaker tracing in the PIT framework so that separation and tracing can be carried out in one step and trained end-to-end. This is achieved using recurrent neural networks (RNNs) by forcing separated frames belonging to the same speaker to be aligned to the same output layer during training. Furthermore, the computational cost introduced by PIT is very small compared to the RNN computation during training and is zero during separation. We evaluated PIT on the WSJ0 and Danish two- and three-talker mixed-speech separation tasks and found that it compares favorably to non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), computational auditory scene analysis (CASA), deep clustering (DPCL) and deep attractor network (DANet), and generalizes well over unseen speakers and languages.|despit signific progress made recent year dictat singl talker speech progress made speaker independ multi talker mix speech separ trace often refer cocktail parti problem less impress paper propos novel techniqu attack problem core techniqu permut invari train pit aim minim sourc stream reconstruct error matter label order achiev align label output stream automat dure train time strategi effect solv label permut problem observ deep learn base techniqu speech separ interest approach integr speaker trace pit framework separ trace carri one step train end end achiev use recurr neural network rnns forc separ frame belong speaker align output layer dure train furthermor comput cost introduc pit veri small compar rnn comput dure train zero dure separ evalu pit wsj danish two three talker mix speech separ task found compar favor non negat matrix factor nmf comput auditori scene analysi casa deep cluster dpcl deep attractor network danet general well unseen speaker languag|['Morten Kolbæk', 'Dong Yu', 'Zheng-Hua Tan', 'Jesper Jensen']|['cs.SD', 'cs.LG']

Current research provides sufficient reason to expect that the human voice may carry biomarkers or signatures of many, if not all, these symptoms. Based on this conjecture, we explore the possibility of objectively and automatically grading the symptoms of psychiatric illnesses with reference to various standard psychiatric rating scales. Using acoustic data from several clinician-patient interviews within hospital settings, we use non-parametric models to learn and predict the relations between symptom-ratings and voice. In the process, we show that different articulatory-phonetic units of speech are able to capture the effects of different symptoms differently, and use this to establish a plausible methodology that could be employed for automatically grading psychiatric symptoms for clinical purposes.|psychiatr ill often associ multipl symptom whose sever must grade accur diagnosi treatment grade usual done train clinician base human observ judgment made within doctor patient session current research provid suffici reason expect human voic may carri biomark signatur mani symptom base conjectur explor possibl object automat grade symptom psychiatr ill refer various standard psychiatr rate scale use acoust data sever clinician patient interview within hospit set use non parametr model learn predict relat symptom rate voic process show differ articulatori phonet unit speech abl captur effect differ symptom differ use establish plausibl methodolog could employ automat grade psychiatr symptom clinic purpos|['Rita Singh', 'Justin Baker', 'Luciana Pennant', 'Louis-Philippe Morency']|['cs.SD', 'q-bio.NC']

This knowledge is obtained from training data for which methods from machine learning are used, e.g., Mixtures of Gaussians, nonnegative matrix factorization, and deep neural networks. If only speech envelopes are employed as prior speech knowledge, e.g., to meet requirements in terms of computational complexity and memory consumption, Wiener-like enhancement filters will not be able to reduce noise components between speech spectral harmonics. In this paper, we highlight the role of clean speech estimators that employ super-Gaussian speech priors in particular for pre- trained approaches when spectral envelope models are used. In the 2000s, such estimators have been considered by many researchers for improving non-trained enhancement schemes. However, while the benefit of super-Gaussian clean speech estimators in non-trained enhancement schemes is limited, we point out that these estimators make a much larger difference for enhancement schemes that employ pre-trained envelope models. We show that for such pre-trained enhancements schemes super- Gaussian estimators allow for a suppression of annoying residual noises which are not reduced using Gaussian filters such as the Wiener filter. As a consequence, considerable improvements in terms of Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality and segmental signal-to-noise ratios are achieved.|enhanc noisi signal pre train singl channel speech enhanc scheme exploit prior knowledg shape typic speech structur knowledg obtain train data method machin learn use mixtur gaussian nonneg matrix factor deep neural network onli speech envelop employ prior speech knowledg meet requir term comput complex memori consumpt wiener like enhanc filter abl reduc nois compon speech spectral harmon paper highlight role clean speech estim employ super gaussian speech prior particular pre train approach spectral envelop model use estim consid mani research improv non train enhanc scheme howev benefit super gaussian clean speech estim non train enhanc scheme limit point estim make much larger differ enhanc scheme employ pre train envelop model show pre train enhanc scheme super gaussian estim allow suppress annoy residu nois reduc use gaussian filter wiener filter consequ consider improv term perceptu evalu speech qualiti segment signal nois ratio achiev|['Robert Rehr', 'Timo Gerkmann']|['cs.SD']

The proposed system performs speech enhancement in an end-to-end (i.e., waveform-in and waveform-out) manner, which dif-fers from most existing denoising methods that process the magnitude spectrum (e.g., log power spectrum (LPS)) only. Because the fully connected layers, which are involved in deep neural networks (DNN) and convolutional neural networks (CNN), may not accurately characterize the local information of speech signals, particularly with high frequency components, we employed fully convolutional layers to model the waveform. More specifically, FCN consists of only convolutional layers and thus the local temporal structures of speech signals can be efficiently and effectively preserved with relatively few weights. Experimental results show that DNN- and CNN-based models have limited capability to restore high frequency components of waveforms, thus leading to decreased intelligibility of enhanced speech. By contrast, the proposed FCN model can not only effectively recover the waveforms but also outperform the LPS-based DNN baseline in terms of short-time objective intelligibility (STOI) and perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ). In addition, the number of model parameters in FCN is approximately only 0.2% compared with that in both DNN and CNN.|studi propos fulli convolut network fcn model raw waveform base speech enhanc propos system perform speech enhanc end end waveform waveform manner dif fer exist denois method process magnitud spectrum log power spectrum lps onli becaus fulli connect layer involv deep neural network dnn convolut neural network cnn may accur character local inform speech signal particular high frequenc compon employ fulli convolut layer model waveform specif fcn consist onli convolut layer thus local tempor structur speech signal effici effect preserv relat weight experiment result show dnn cnn base model limit capabl restor high frequenc compon waveform thus lead decreas intellig enhanc speech contrast propos fcn model onli effect recov waveform also outperform lps base dnn baselin term short time object intellig stoi perceptu evalu speech qualiti pesq addit number model paramet fcn approxim onli compar dnn cnn|['Szu-Wei Fu', 'Yu Tsao', 'Xugang Lu', 'Hisashi Kawai']|['stat.ML', 'cs.LG', 'cs.SD']

However, music auto-tagging is distinguished from image classification in that the tags are highly diverse and have different levels of abstractions. Considering this issue, we propose a convolutional neural networks (CNN)-based architecture that embraces multi-level and multi-scaled features. The architecture is trained in three steps. First, we conduct supervised feature learning to capture local audio features using a set of CNNs with different input sizes. Second, we extract audio features from each layer of the pre-trained convolutional networks separately and aggregate them altogether given a long audio clip. Finally, we put them into fully-connected networks and make final predictions of the tags. Our experiments show that using the combination of multi-level and multi-scale features is highly effective in music auto-tagging and the proposed method outperforms previous state-of-the-arts on the Magnatagatune dataset and the million song dataset.

This approach was applied to musical signals as well but has been not fully explored yet. To this end, we propose sample-level deep convolutional neural networks which learn representations from very small grains of waveforms (e.g. 2 or 3 samples) beyond typical frame-level input representations. This allows the networks to hierarchically learn filters that are sensitive to log-scaled frequency, such as mel-frequency spectrogram that is widely used in music classification systems. It also helps learning high-level abstraction of music by increasing the depth of layers. We show how deep architectures with sample-level filters improve the accuracy in music auto-tagging and they provide results that are com- parable to previous state-of-the-art performances for the Magnatagatune dataset and Million song dataset.

In this work, we propose a new embedding scheme, sound-word2vec that learns language embeddings by grounding them in sound -- for example, two seemingly unrelated concepts, leaves and paper are closer in our embedding space as they produce similar rustling sounds.

In order to improve the reliability of speaker verification systems, we develop a new filter bank based cepstral feature, deep neural network filter bank cepstral coefficients (DNN-FBCC), to distinguish between natural and spoofed speech. The deep neural network filter bank is automatically generated by training a filter bank neural network (FBNN) using natural and synthetic speech. By adding restrictions on the training rules, the learned weight matrix of FBNN is band-limited and sorted by frequency, similar to the normal filter bank. Unlike the manually designed filter bank, the learned filter bank has different filter shapes in different channels, which can capture the differences between natural and synthetic speech more effectively. The experimental results on the ASVspoof {2015} database show that the Gaussian mixture model maximum-likelihood (GMM-ML) classifier trained by the new feature performs better than the state-of-the-art linear frequency cepstral coefficients (LFCC) based classifier, especially on detecting unknown attacks.|develop speech synthesi techniqu automat speaker verif system face serious challeng spoof attack order improv reliabl speaker verif system develop new filter bank base cepstral featur deep neural network filter bank cepstral coeffici dnn fbcc distinguish natur spoof speech deep neural network filter bank automat generat train filter bank neural network fbnn use natur synthet speech ad restrict train rule learn weight matrix fbnn band limit sort frequenc similar normal filter bank unlik manual design filter bank learn filter bank differ filter shape differ channel captur differ natur synthet speech effect experiment result asvspoof databas show gaussian mixtur model maximum likelihood gmm ml classifi train new featur perform better state art linear frequenc cepstral coeffici lfcc base classifi especi detect unknown attack|['Hong Yu', 'Zheng-Hua Tan', 'Zhanyu Ma', 'Jun Guo']|['cs.SD', 'cs.CR', 'cs.LG']

With optimized features and model training, it achieves 100% classification rate in classification and less than 6% Equal Error Rate (ERR), using merely about 1 second and 5 seconds of data respectively. Features with stricter Voice Active Detection (VAD) than the regular one for speech recognition ensure extracting stronger voiced portion for speaker recognition, speaker-level mean and variance normalization helps to eliminate the discrepancy between samples from the same speaker. Both are proven to improve the system performance. In building the neural network speaker classifier, the network structure parameters are optimized with grid search and dynamically reduced regularization parameters are used to avoid training terminated in local minimum. It enables the training goes further with lower cost. In speaker verification, performance is improved with prediction score normalization, which rewards the speaker identity indices with distinct peaks and penalizes the weak ones with high scores but more competitors, and speaker-specific thresholding, which significantly reduces ERR in the ROC curve.

These transformed features demonstrate very distinctive patterns, which facilitates differentiating speakers and enable speaker change detection with some straight-forward distance metrics. The speaker classifier and the speaker change detector are trained/tested using speech of the first 200 (in-domain) and the remaining 126 (out-of-domain) male speakers in TIMIT respectively.

Traditionally, first-order models such as Hidden Markov Models were used for this task, with recent works suggesting to apply Recurrent Neural Networks instead. Due to their ability to learn longer-term dependencies, these models are supposed to learn and to apply musical knowledge, instead of just smoothing the output of the acoustic model. In this paper, we argue that learning complex temporal models at the level of audio frames is futile on principle, and that non-Markovian models do not perform better than their first-order counterparts. We support our argument through three experiments on the McGill Billboard dataset. The first two show 1) that when learning complex temporal models at the frame level, improvements in chord sequence modelling are marginal; and 2) that these improvements do not translate when applied within a full chord recognition system. The third, still rather preliminary experiment gives first indications that the use of complex sequential models for chord prediction at higher temporal levels might be more promising.|chord recognit system use tempor model post process frame wise chord predit acoust model tradit first order model hidden markov model use task recent work suggest appli recurr neural network instead due abil learn longer term depend model suppos learn appli music knowledg instead smooth output acoust model paper argu learn complex tempor model level audio frame futil principl non markovian model perform better first order counterpart support argument three experi mcgill billboard dataset first two show learn complex tempor model frame level improv chord sequenc model margin improv translat appli within full chord recognit system third still rather preliminari experi give first indic use complex sequenti model chord predict higher tempor level might promis|['Filip Korzeniowski', 'Gerhard Widmer']|['cs.SD', 'cs.LG']

This model solves a major problem of conventional methods that could not properly describe the nature of multiple voices as in polyrhythmic scores or in the phenomenon of loose synchrony between voices. In this paper we present a complete description of the proposed model and develop an inference technique, which is valid for any merged-output HMMs for which output probabilities depend on past events. We also examine the influence of the architecture and parameters of the method in terms of accuracies of rhythm transcription and voice separation and perform comparative evaluations with six other algorithms. Using MIDI recordings of classical piano pieces, we found that the proposed model outperformed other methods by more than 12 points in the accuracy for polyrhythmic performances and performed almost as good as the best one for non-polyrhythmic performances.

These representations are derived through cascades of neuronal processing stages in which neurons at each stage recode the output of preceding stages. Explanations of sensory coding may thus involve understanding how low-level patterns are combined into more complex structures. Although models exist in the visual domain to explain how mid-level features such as junctions and curves might be derived from oriented filters in early visual cortex, little is known about analogous grouping principles for mid-level auditory representations. We propose a hierarchical generative model of natural sounds that learns combinations of spectrotemporal features from natural stimulus statistics. In the first layer the model forms a sparse convolutional code of spectrograms using a dictionary of learned spectrotemporal kernels. To generalize from specific kernel activation patterns, the second layer encodes patterns of time-varying magnitude of multiple first layer coefficients. Because second-layer features are sensitive to combinations of spectrotemporal features, the representation they support encodes more complex acoustic patterns than the first layer. When trained on corpora of speech and environmental sounds, some second-layer units learned to group spectrotemporal features that occur together in natural sounds. Others instantiate opponency between dissimilar sets of spectrotemporal features. Such groupings might be instantiated by neurons in the auditory cortex, providing a hypothesis for mid-level neuronal computation.|interact world requir organ transform sensori signal represent behavior meaning properti environ made explicit represent deriv cascad neuron process stage neuron stage recod output preced stage explan sensori code may thus involv understand low level pattern combin complex structur although model exist visual domain explain mid level featur junction curv might deriv orient filter earli visual cortex littl known analog group principl mid level auditori represent propos hierarch generat model natur sound learn combin spectrotempor featur natur stimulus statist first layer model form spars convolut code spectrogram use dictionari learn spectrotempor kernel general specif kernel activ pattern second layer encod pattern time vari magnitud multipl first layer coeffici becaus second layer featur sensit combin spectrotempor featur represent support encod complex acoust pattern first layer train corpora speech environment sound second layer unit learn group spectrotempor featur occur togeth natur sound instanti oppon dissimilar set spectrotempor featur group might instanti neuron auditori cortex provid hypothesi mid level neuron comput|['Wiktor Młynarski', 'Josh H.

A significant aspect missing in previous works is the self-learnability of repetitive vowel patterns in the singing voice, where the vowel part used is more consistent than the consonant part. Based on this, our system first learns a discriminative subspace of vowel sequences, based on weighted symmetric non-negative matrix factorization (WS-NMF), by taking the self-similarity of a standard acoustic feature as an input. Then, we make use of canonical time warping (CTW), derived from a recent computer vision technique, to find an optimal spatiotemporal transformation between the text and the acoustic sequences.

However, it is not always guaranteed that the stretched music piece is acceptable for general audience since music stretching suffers from people's perceptual artefacts. Over-stretching a music piece will make it uncomfortable for human psychoacoustic hearing. The research on music stretching resistance attempts to estimate the maximum stretchability of music pieces to further avoid over-stretch. It has been observed that musical genres can significantly improve the accuracy of automatic estimation of music stretching resistance, but how musical genres are related to music stretching resistance has never been explained or studied in detail in the literature. In this paper, the characteristics of music stretching resistance are compared across different musical genres. It is found that music stretching resistance has strong intra-genre cohesiveness and inter-genre discrepancies in the experiments. Moreover, the ambiguity and the symmetry of music stretching resistance are also observed in the experimental analysis. These findings lead to a new measurement on the similarity between different musical genres based on their music stretching resistance.

However, extracting behavior information from speech is still a difficult task due to the sparseness of training data coupled with the complex, high-dimensionality of speech, and the complex and multiple information streams it encodes. In this work we exploit the slow varying properties of human behavior. We hypothesize that nearby segments of speech share the same behavioral context and hence share a similar underlying representation in a latent space.

We evaluate the proposed manifold in the couples therapy domain and also provide examples from publicly available data (e.g. stand-up comedy).

A plain LSTM has an internal memory cell that can learn long term dependencies of sequential data. It also provides a temporal shortcut path to avoid vanishing or exploding gradients in the temporal domain. The residual LSTM provides an additional spatial shortcut path from lower layers for efficient training of deep networks with multiple LSTM layers. Compared with the previous work, highway LSTM, residual LSTM separates a spatial shortcut path with temporal one by using output layers, which can help to avoid a conflict between spatial and temporal-domain gradient flows. Furthermore, residual LSTM reuses the output projection matrix and the output gate of LSTM to control the spatial information flow instead of additional gate networks, which effectively reduces more than 10% of network parameters. An experiment for distant speech recognition on the AMI SDM corpus shows that 10-layer plain and highway LSTM networks presented 13.7% and 6.2% increase in WER over 3-layer aselines, respectively.

In contrast to speech, sounds coming from audio events may be produced by a wide variety of sources. Furthermore, distinguishing them often requires analyzing an extended time period due to the lack of clear sub-word units that are present in speech. In order to incorporate this long-time frequency structure of audio events, we introduce a convolutional neural network (CNN) operating on a large temporal input. In contrast to previous works this allows us to train an audio event detection system end-to-end. The combination of our network architecture and a novel data augmentation outperforms previous methods for audio event detection by 16%. Furthermore, we perform transfer learning and show that our model learnt generic audio features, similar to the way CNNs learn generic features on vision tasks. In video analysis, combining visual features and traditional audio features such as MFCC typically only leads to marginal improvements. Instead, combining visual features with our AENet features, which can be computed efficiently on a GPU, leads to significant performance improvements on action recognition and video highlight detection. In video highlight detection, our audio features improve the performance by more than 8% over visual features alone.|propos new deep network audio event recognit call aenet contrast speech sound come audio event may produc wide varieti sourc furthermor distinguish often requir analyz extend time period due lack clear sub word unit present speech order incorpor long time frequenc structur audio event introduc convolut neural network cnn oper larg tempor input contrast previous work allow us train audio event detect system end end combin network architectur novel data augment outperform previous method audio event detect furthermor perform transfer learn show model learnt generic audio featur similar way cnns learn generic featur vision task video analysi combin visual featur tradit audio featur mfcc typic onli lead margin improv instead combin visual featur aenet featur comput effici gpu lead signific perform improv action recognit video highlight detect video highlight detect audio featur improv perform visual featur alon|['Naoya Takahashi', 'Michael Gygli', 'Luc Van Gool']|['cs.MM', 'cs.CV', 'cs.SD']

This work proposes a complex-valued Gaussian process latent variable model (CGPLVM) to enhance directly the complex-valued noisy spectrum, modifying not only the magnitude but also the phase. The main idea that underlies the developed method is the modeling of short-time Fourier transform (STFT) coefficients across the time frames of a speech as a proper complex Gaussian process (GP) with noise added. The proposed method is based on projecting the spectrum into a low-dimensional subspace. The likelihood criterion is used to optimize the hyperparameters of the model.

So far, this observation has been accepted as a fact and we lack a careful analysis. In this paper, we reason the rationale behind this fact and, more importantly, leverage them to benefit the audio event detection task. We present an improved detection pipeline in which a verification step is appended to augment a detection system. This step employs a high-quality event classifier to postprocess the benign event hypotheses outputted by the detection system and reject false alarms. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed pipeline, we implement and pair up different event detectors based on the most common detection schemes and various event classifiers, ranging from the standard bag-of-words model to the state-of-the-art bank-of-regressors one.

Speech-language pathologists (SLPs) work with patients with PD to improve speech intelligibility using various intensive in-clinic speech treatments. SLPs also prescribe home exercises to enhance generalization of speech strategies outside of the treatment room. Even though speech therapies are found to be highly effective in improving vocal loudness and speech quality, patients with PD find it difficult to follow the prescribed exercise regimes outside the clinic and to continue exercises once the treatment is completed. SLPs need techniques to monitor compliance and accuracy of their patients exercises at home and in ecologically valid communication situations. We have designed EchoWear, a smartwatch-based system, to remotely monitor speech and voice exercises as prescribed by SLPs. We conducted a study of 6 individuals; three with PD and three healthy controls. To assess the performance of EchoWear technology compared with high quality audio equipment obtained in a speech laboratory.

However such devices may record more than an animals vocal behaviour, and have the potential to be used for investigating specific activities (movement) and context (background) within which vocalisations occur. To facilitate this approach, we investigate the automatic annotation of such recordings through two different sound scene analysis paradigms: a scene-classification method using feature learning, and an event-detection method using probabilistic latent component analysis (PLCA). We analyse recordings made with Eurasian jackdaws (Corvus monedula) in both captive and field settings.

To that end, we extend an existing model that was designed to model expressive piano performances, and describe the additional steps necessary for the model to deal with scores of arbitrary instrumentation, including orchestral scores. We test both linear and non-linear variants of the extended model n a data set of audio recordings of symphonic music, in a leave-one-out setting.

This NN based linear projection helps to realize multimodal data fusion (i.e., EEG and acoustic signals). It is convenient to construct the mapping between unspoken EEG signals and phonemes. Specifically, among three NES models, two augmented models (i.e., IANES-B and IANES-G) include spoken EEG signals as either bias or gate information to strengthen the feature learning and translation of unspoken EEG signals. A combined unsupervised and supervised training is implemented stepwise to learn the mapping for all three NES models. To enhance the computational performance, three way factored NN training technique is applied to IANES-G model. Unlike many existing methods, our augmented NES models incorporate spoken-EEG signals that can efficiently suppress the artifacts in unspoken-EEG signals.

Applying a preliminary onset detection algorithm, the obtained time-frequency representation implies good time resolution for the onsets and good frequency resolution for the sinusoidal components.   The phase estimates are done only at peak channels using quadratic interpolation and the remaining phases are then locked to the values of the peaks in an adaptive manner. In contrast to previous attempts we let the number of frequency channels vary over time in order to obtain a low redundancy of the corresponding transform. We show that with a redundancy comparable to that of the phase vocoder we can greatly reduce artefacts such as phasiness and transient smearing.

The extracted features are processed by a Conditional Random Field that decodes the final chord sequence. Both processing stages are trained automatically and do not require expert knowledge for optimising parameters. We show that the learned auditory system extracts musically interpretable features, and that the proposed chord recognition system achieves results on par or better than state-of-the-art algorithms.|chord recognit system depend robust featur extract pipelin pipelin tradit hand craft recent advanc end end machin learn begun inspir research explor data driven method task paper present chord recognit system use fulli convolut deep auditori model featur extract extract featur process condit random field decod final chord sequenc process stage train automat requir expert knowledg optimis paramet show learn auditori system extract music interpret featur propos chord recognit system achiev result par better state art algorithm|['Filip Korzeniowski', 'Gerhard Widmer']|['cs.LG', 'cs.SD']

We present the argument that chroma vectors potentially hold enough information to model harmonic content of audio for chord recognition, but that standard chroma extractors compute too noisy features. This leads us to propose a learned chroma feature extractor based on artificial neural networks. It is trained to compute chroma features that encode harmonic information important for chord recognition, while being robust to irrelevant interferences. We achieve this by feeding the network an audio spectrum with context instead of a single frame as input. This way, the network can learn to selectively compensate noise and resolve harmonic ambiguities.   We compare the resulting features to hand-crafted ones by using a simple linear frame-wise classifier for chord recognition on various data sets. The results show that the learned feature extractor produces superior chroma vectors for chord recognition.|explor frame level audio featur learn chord recognit use artifici neural network present argument chroma vector potenti hold enough inform model harmon content audio chord recognit standard chroma extractor comput noisi featur lead us propos learn chroma featur extractor base artifici neural network train comput chroma featur encod harmon inform import chord recognit robust irrelev interfer achiev feed network audio spectrum context instead singl frame input way network learn select compens nois resolv harmon ambigu compar result featur hand craft one use simpl linear frame wise classifi chord recognit various data set result show learn featur extractor produc superior chroma vector chord recognit|['Filip Korzeniowski', 'Gerhard Widmer']|['cs.SD', 'cs.LG']

We first examine whether a unit selection method, that is restricted to a finite size unit library, can be sufficient for encompassing a wide spectrum of music. We do this by developing a deep autoencoder that encodes a musical input and reconstructs the input by selecting from the library.

Cepstral analysis of underwater acoustic data enables the time delay between the direct path arrival and the first multipath arrival to be measured, which in turn enables estimation of the instantaneous range of the source (a small boat). However, this conventional method is limited to ranges where the Lloyd's mirror effect (interference pattern formed between the direct and first multipath arrivals) is discernible. This paper proposes the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for the joint detection and ranging of broadband acoustic noise sources such as marine vessels in conjunction with a data augmentation approach for improving network performance in varied signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) situations. Performance is compared with a conventional passive sonar ranging method for monitoring marine vessel activity using real data from a single hydrophone mounted above the sea floor.

RCN is compact since all microtonal adjustments can be represented by a single notational unit based on a rational number. RCN has different versions depending on the choice of algorithm to assign a prime comma to each prime number. Two existing algorithms SAG and KG are found in the literature. A novel algorithm DR is developed based on discussion of mathematical and musical criteria for algorithm design. Results for DR are presented for primes below 1400. Some observations are made about these results and their applications, including shorthand notation and pitch class lattices. Results for DR are compared with those for SAG and KG. Translation is possible between any two free-JI notations and any two versions of RCN since they all represent the same underlying set of rational numbers.|music frequenc inton compris ration number structur ration number determin prime factoris inton frequenc split two compon larger compon use onli integ power first two prime smaller compon decompos seri microton adjust one prime number abov present origin frequenc larger limit compon notat use scientif pitch notat modifi use pythagorean tune microton adjust notat use ration comma built prime comma give notat system whole free ji call ration comma notat rcn compact sinc microton adjust repres singl notat unit base ration number rcn differ version depend choic algorithm assign prime comma prime number two exist algorithm sag kg found literatur novel algorithm dr develop base discuss mathemat music criteria algorithm design result dr present prime observ made result applic includ shorthand notat pitch class lattic result dr compar sag kg translat possibl ani two free ji notat ani two version rcn sinc repres set ration number|['David Ryan']|['cs.SD']

The art of Bach chorales composition involves combining four-part harmony with characteristic rhythmic patterns and typical melodic movements to produce musical phrases which begin, evolve and end (cadences) in a harmonious way. To our knowledge, no model so far was able to solve all these problems simultaneously using an agnostic machine-learning approach. This paper introduces DeepBach, a statistical model aimed at modeling polyphonic music and specifically four parts, hymn-like pieces. We claim that, after being trained on the chorale harmonizations by Johann Sebastian Bach, our model is capable of generating highly convincing chorales in the style of Bach. We evaluate how indistinguishable our generated chorales are from existing Bach chorales with a listening test. The results corroborate our claim. A key strength of DeepBach is that it is agnostic and flexible. Users can constrain the generation by imposing some notes, rhythms or cadences in the generated score. This allows users to reharmonize user-defined melodies. DeepBach's generation is fast, making it usable for interactive music composition applications. Several generation examples are provided and discussed from a musical point of view.|composit polyphon choral music style bach repres major challeng automat music composit last decad art bach choral composit involv combin four part harmoni characterist rhythmic pattern typic melod movement produc music phrase begin evolv end cadenc harmoni way knowledg model far abl solv problem simultan use agnost machin learn approach paper introduc deepbach statist model aim model polyphon music specif four part hymn like piec claim train choral harmon johann sebastian bach model capabl generat high convinc choral style bach evalu indistinguish generat choral exist bach choral listen test result corrobor claim key strength deepbach agnost flexibl user constrain generat impos note rhythm cadenc generat score allow user reharmon user defin melodi deepbach generat fast make usabl interact music composit applic sever generat exampl provid discuss music point view|['Gaëtan Hadjeres', 'François Pachet']|['cs.AI', 'cs.SD']

The Alap is the opening section of a typical Hindustani Music (HM) performance, where the raga is introduced and the paths of its development are revealed using all the notes used in that particular raga and allowed transitions between them with proper distribution over time. In India, corresponding to each raga, several emotional flavors are listed, namely erotic love, pathetic, devotional, comic, horrific, repugnant, heroic, fantastic, furious, peaceful. The detection of emotional cues from Hindustani Classical music is a demanding task due to the inherent ambiguity present in the different ragas, which makes it difficult to identify any particular emotion from a certain raga. In this study we took the help of a high resolution mathematical microscope (MFDFA or Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis) to procure information about the inherent complexities and time series fluctuations that constitute an acoustic signal. With the help of this technique, 3 min alap portion of six conventional ragas of Hindustani classical music namely, Darbari Kanada, Yaman, Mian ki Malhar, Durga, Jay Jayanti and Hamswadhani played in three different musical instruments were analyzed.

Expressive features should both improve the performance of the tasks and also be interpret-able. Currently, heuristically designed features based on the domain knowledge requires tremendous effort in hand-crafting, while features extracted through deep network are difficult for human to interpret. In this work, we explore the experience guided learning method for designing acoustic features. This is a novel hybrid approach combining both domain knowledge and purely data driven feature designing. Based on the procedure of log Mel-filter banks, we design a filter bank learning layer. We concatenate this layer with a convolutional neural network (CNN) model. After training the network, the weight of the filter bank learning layer is extracted to facilitate the design of acoustic features. We smooth the trained weight of the learning layer and re-initialize it in filter bank learning layer as audio feature extractor. For the environmental sound recognition task based on the Urban- sound8K dataset, the experience guided learning leads to a 2% accuracy improvement compared with the fixed feature extractors (the log Mel-filter bank). The shape of the new filter banks are visualized and explained to prove the effectiveness of the feature design process.|design appropri featur acoust event recognit task activ field research express featur improv perform task also interpret abl current heurist design featur base domain knowledg requir tremend effort hand craft featur extract deep network difficult human interpret work explor experi guid learn method design acoust featur novel hybrid approach combin domain knowledg pure data driven featur design base procedur log mel filter bank design filter bank learn layer concaten layer convolut neural network cnn model train network weight filter bank learn layer extract facilit design acoust featur smooth train weight learn layer initi filter bank learn layer audio featur extractor environment sound recognit task base urban soundk dataset experi guid learn lead accuraci improv compar fix featur extractor log mel filter bank shape new filter bank visual explain prove effect featur design process|['Shuhui Qu', 'Juncheng Li', 'Wei Dai', 'Samarjit Das']|['cs.SD', 'cs.AI']

Two major difficulties in such systems are the arbitrary source permutation and unknown number of sources in the mixture. We propose a novel deep learning framework for single channel speech separation by creating attractor points in high dimensional embedding space of the acoustic signals which pull together the time-frequency bins corresponding to each source. Attractor points in this study are created by finding the centroids of the sources in the embedding space, which are subsequently used to determine the similarity of each bin in the mixture to each source. The network is then trained to minimize the reconstruction error of each source by optimizing the embeddings. The proposed model is different from prior works in that it implements an end-to-end training, and it does not depend on the number of sources in the mixture. Two strategies are explored in the test time, K-means and fixed attractor points, where the latter requires no post-processing and can be implemented in real-time. We evaluated our system on Wall Street Journal dataset and show 5.49\% improvement over the previous state-of-the-art methods.|despit overwhelm success deep learn various speech process task problem separ simultan speaker mixtur remain challeng two major difficulti system arbitrari sourc permut unknown number sourc mixtur propos novel deep learn framework singl channel speech separ creat attractor point high dimension embed space acoust signal pull togeth time frequenc bin correspond sourc attractor point studi creat find centroid sourc embed space subsequ use determin similar bin mixtur sourc network train minim reconstruct error sourc optim embed propos model differ prior work implement end end train doe depend number sourc mixtur two strategi explor test time mean fix attractor point latter requir post process implement real time evalu system wall street journal dataset show improv previous state art method|['Zhuo Chen', 'Yi Luo', 'Nima Mesgarani']|['cs.SD', 'cs.LG']

Ensuring such robustness to variability is a challenge in modern day neural network-based ASR systems, especially when all types of variability are not seen during training. We attempt to address this problem by encouraging the neural network acoustic model to learn invariant feature representations. We use ideas from recent research on image generation using Generative Adversarial Networks and domain adaptation ideas extending adversarial gradient-based training. A recent work from Ganin et al. proposes to use adversarial training for image domain adaptation by using an intermediate representation from the main target classification network to deteriorate the domain classifier performance through a separate neural network. Our work focuses on investigating neural architectures which produce representations invariant to noise conditions for ASR. We evaluate the proposed architecture on the Aurora-4 task, a popular benchmark for noise robust ASR. We show that our method generalizes better than the standard multi-condition training especially when only a few noise categories are seen during training.|modern automat speech recognit asr system need robust acoust variabl aris environment speaker channel record condit ensur robust variabl challeng modern day neural network base asr system especi type variabl seen dure train attempt address problem encourag neural network acoust model learn invari featur represent use idea recent research imag generat use generat adversari network domain adapt idea extend adversari gradient base train recent work ganin et al propos use adversari train imag domain adapt use intermedi represent main target classif network deterior domain classifi perform separ neural network work focus investig neural architectur produc represent invari nois condit asr evalu propos architectur aurora task popular benchmark nois robust asr show method general better standard multi condit train especi onli nois categori seen dure train|['Dmitriy Serdyuk', 'Kartik Audhkhasi', 'Philémon Brakel', 'Bhuvana Ramabhadran', 'Samuel Thomas', 'Yoshua Bengio']|['cs.CL', 'cs.CV', 'cs.LG', 'cs.SD', 'stat.ML']

First, we start from the classical adaptive noise cancelling approach, and adjust it to the problem at hand. In a second step, we compare some adaptive and Wiener filtering approaches and assess their performances on the task. Our findings underpin that adaptive filtering is inapt of dealing with music signals and that Wiener filtering in the short-time Fourier transform domain is a much more effective approach.
