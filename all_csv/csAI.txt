We propose to use a pretrained convnet feature, a concatenated feature vector using activations of feature maps of multiple layers in a trained convolutional network. We show that how this convnet feature can serve as a general-purpose music representation. In the experiment, a convnet is trained for music tagging and then transferred for many music-related classification and regression tasks as well as an audio-related classification task. In experiments, the convnet feature outperforms the baseline MFCC feature in all tasks and many reported approaches of aggregating MFCCs and low- and high-level music features.|paper present transfer learn approach music classif regress task propos use pretrain convnet featur concaten featur vector use activ featur map multipl layer train convolut network show convnet featur serv general purpos music represent experi convnet train music tag transfer mani music relat classif regress task well audio relat classif task experi convnet featur outperform baselin mfcc featur task mani report approach aggreg mfccs low high level music featur|['Keunwoo Choi', 'György Fazekas', 'Mark Sandler', 'Kyunghyun Cho']|['cs.CV', 'cs.AI', 'cs.MM', 'cs.SD']

Recently, a variant of RRT called RRT* has been proposed that ensures asymptotic optimality. Subsequently its bidirectional version has also been introduced in the literature known as Bidirectional-RRT* (B-RRT*). We introduce a new variant called Intelligent Bidirectional-RRT* (IB-RRT*) which is an improved variant of the optimal RRT* and bidirectional version of RRT* (B-RRT*) algorithms and is specially designed for complex cluttered environments. IB-RRT* utilizes the bidirectional trees approach and introduces intelligent sample insertion heuristic for fast convergence to the optimal path solution using uniform sampling heuristics. The proposed algorithm is evaluated theoretically and experimental results are presented that compares IB-RRT* with RRT* and B-RRT*. Moreover, experimental results demonstrate the superior efficiency of IB-RRT* in comparison with RRT* and B-RRT in complex cluttered environments.|sampl base motion plan algorithm known rapid explor random tree rrt gain attent mani research due comput effici effect recent variant rrt call rrt propos ensur asymptot optim subsequ bidirect version also introduc literatur known bidirect rrt rrt introduc new variant call intellig bidirect rrt ib rrt improv variant optim rrt bidirect version rrt rrt algorithm special design complex clutter environ ib rrt util bidirect tree approach introduc intellig sampl insert heurist fast converg optim path solut use uniform sampl heurist propos algorithm evalu theoret experiment result present compar ib rrt rrt rrt moreov experiment result demonstr superior effici ib rrt comparison rrt rrt complex clutter environ|['Ahmed Hussain Qureshi', 'Yasar Ayaz']|['cs.RO', 'cs.AI']

The goal in this paper is to automate $\mathcal{DDE}$. We briefly present $\mathcal{DDE}$, and use a first-order modal logic, the deontic cognitive event calculus, as our framework to formalize the doctrine. We present formalizations of increasingly stronger versions of the principle, including what is known as the doctrine of triple effect. We then use our framework to simulate successfully scenarios that have been used to test for the presence of the principle in human subjects. Our framework can be used in two different modes: One can use it to build $\mathcal{DDE}$-compliant autonomous systems from scratch, or one can use it to verify that a given AI system is $\mathcal{DDE}$-compliant, by applying a $\mathcal{DDE}$ layer on an existing system or model. For the latter mode, the underlying AI system can be built using any architecture (planners, deep neural networks, bayesian networks, knowledge-representation systems, or a hybrid); as long as the system exposes a few parameters in its model, such verification is possible. The role of the $\mathcal{DDE}$ layer here is akin to a (dynamic or static) software verifier that examines existing software modules. Finally, we end by presenting initial work on how one can apply our $\mathcal{DDE}$ layer to the STRIPS-style planning model, and to a modified POMDP model.|doctrin doubl effect mathcal dde long studi ethic principl govern action posit negat effect allow goal paper autom mathcal dde briefli present mathcal dde use first order modal logic deontic cognit event calculus framework formal doctrin present formal increas stronger version principl includ known doctrin tripl effect use framework simul success scenario use test presenc principl human subject framework use two differ mode one use build mathcal dde compliant autonom system scratch one use verifi given ai system mathcal dde compliant appli mathcal dde layer exist system model latter mode ai system built use ani architectur planner deep neural network bayesian network knowledg represent system hybrid long system expos paramet model verif possibl role mathcal dde layer akin dynam static softwar verifi examin exist softwar modul final end present initi work one appli mathcal dde layer strip style plan model modifi pomdp model|['Naveen Sundar Govindarajulu', 'Selmer Bringsjord']|['cs.AI', 'cs.LO', 'cs.RO']

However, while instinctive to humans, socially compliant navigation is still difficult to quantify due to the stochasticity in people's behaviors. Existing works are mostly focused on using feature-matching techniques to describe and imitate human paths, but often do not generalize well since the feature values can vary from person to person, and even run to run. This work notes that while it is challenging to directly specify the details of what to do (precise mechanisms of human navigation), it is straightforward to specify what not to do (violations of social norms). Specifically, using deep reinforcement learning, this work develops a time-efficient navigation policy that respects common social norms. The proposed method is shown to enable fully autonomous navigation of a robotic vehicle moving at human walking speed in an environment with many pedestrians.|robot vehicl navig safe effici pedestrian rich environ import model subtl human behavior navig rule howev instinct human social compliant navig still difficult quantifi due stochast peopl behavior exist work focus use featur match techniqu describ imit human path often general well sinc featur valu vari person person even run run work note challeng direct specifi detail precis mechan human navig straightforward specifi violat social norm specif use deep reinforc learn work develop time effici navig polici respect common social norm propos method shown enabl fulli autonom navig robot vehicl move human walk speed environ mani pedestrian|['Yu Fan Chen', 'Michael Everett', 'Miao Liu', 'Jonathan P.

Patient phenotyping is a classification task for determining whether a patient has a medical condition, and is a crucial part of secondary analysis of healthcare data. We assess the performance of deep learning algorithms and compare them with classical NLP approaches.   Materials and Methods: We compare convolutional neural networks (CNNs), n-gram models, and approaches based on cTAKES that extract pre-defined medical concepts from clinical notes and use them to predict patient phenotypes. The performance is tested on 10 different phenotyping tasks using 1,610 discharge summaries extracted from the MIMIC-III database.   Results: CNNs outperform other phenotyping algorithms in all 10 tasks. The average F1-score of our model is 76 (PPV of 83, and sensitivity of 71) with our model having an F1-score up to 37 points higher than alternative approaches. We additionally assess the interpretability of our model by presenting a method that extracts the most salient phrases for a particular prediction.   Conclusion: We show that NLP methods based on deep learning improve the performance of patient phenotyping. Our CNN-based algorithm automatically learns the phrases associated with each patient phenotype. As such, it reduces the annotation complexity for clinical domain experts, who are normally required to develop task-specific annotation rules and identify relevant phrases. Our method performs well in terms of both performance and interpretability, which indicates that deep learning is an effective approach to patient phenotyping based on clinicians' notes.|object investig whether deep learn techniqu natur languag process nlp use effici patient phenotyp patient phenotyp classif task determin whether patient medic condit crucial part secondari analysi healthcar data assess perform deep learn algorithm compar classic nlp approach materi method compar convolut neural network cnns gram model approach base ctake extract pre defin medic concept clinic note use predict patient phenotyp perform test differ phenotyp task use discharg summari extract mimic iii databas result cnns outperform phenotyp algorithm task averag score model ppv sensit model score point higher altern approach addit assess interpret model present method extract salient phrase particular predict conclus show nlp method base deep learn improv perform patient phenotyp cnn base algorithm automat learn phrase associ patient phenotyp reduc annot complex clinic domain expert normal requir develop task specif annot rule identifi relev phrase method perform well term perform interpret indic deep learn effect approach patient phenotyp base clinician note|['Sebastian Gehrmann', 'Franck Dernoncourt', 'Yeran Li', 'Eric T.

To make our Gaussian assumption reasonable, the IMM procedure utilizes various transfer learning techniques including weight transfer, L2-norm of old and new parameters, and a newly proposed variant of dropout using old parameters. We analyze our methods on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, and then evaluate them on a real-world life-log dataset collected using Google Glass.

But for safety critical applications, guarantees of system performance described by formal specifications are desired, which motivates us to consider formal methods to synthesize supervisor for POMDP.

Based on observations that the pitch context and onset score times are influential on the configuration of note values, we construct a context-tree model that provides prior distributions of note values using these features and combine it with a performance model in the framework of Markov random fields. Evaluation results showed that our method reduces the average error rate by around 40 percent compared to existing/simple methods.

In this work, we study the containment problem for OMQs expressed in such formalisms, which is a key ingredient for solving static analysis tasks associated with them.

However, the best-known methods (e.g., Katyusha) requires at least two auxiliary variables and two momentum parameters. In this paper, we propose a fast stochastic variance reduction gradient (FSVRG) method, in which we design a novel update rule with the Nesterov's momentum and incorporate the technique of growing epoch size. FSVRG has only one auxiliary variable and one momentum weight, and thus it is much simpler and has much lower per-iteration complexity. We prove that FSVRG achieves linear convergence for strongly convex problems and the optimal $\mathcal{O}(1/T^2)$ convergence rate for non-strongly convex problems, where $T$ is the number of outer-iterations. We also extend FSVRG to directly solve the problems with non-smooth component functions, such as SVM. Finally, we empirically study the performance of FSVRG for solving various machine learning problems such as logistic regression, ridge regression, Lasso and SVM. Our results show that FSVRG outperforms the state-of-the-art stochastic methods, including Katyusha.|recent research acceler stochast gradient descent method svrg made excit progress linear converg strong convex problem howev best known method katyusha requir least two auxiliari variabl two momentum paramet paper propos fast stochast varianc reduct gradient fsvrg method design novel updat rule nesterov momentum incorpor techniqu grow epoch size fsvrg onli one auxiliari variabl one momentum weight thus much simpler much lower per iter complex prove fsvrg achiev linear converg strong convex problem optim mathcal converg rate non strong convex problem number outer iter also extend fsvrg direct solv problem non smooth compon function svm final empir studi perform fsvrg solv various machin learn problem logist regress ridg regress lasso svm result show fsvrg outperform state art stochast method includ katyusha|['Fanhua Shang', 'Yuanyuan Liu', 'James Cheng', 'Jiacheng Zhuo']|['cs.LG', 'cs.AI', 'math.OC', 'stat.ML']

The exact form of this architecture can have a significant effect on the accuracy of the VF estimate, however, and determining a suitable approximation architecture can often be a highly complex task. Consequently there is a large amount of interest in the potential for allowing RL algorithms to adaptively generate (i.e. to learn) approximation architectures.   We investigate a method of adapting approximation architectures which uses feedback regarding the frequency with which an agent has visited certain states to guide which areas of the state space to approximate with greater detail. We introduce an algorithm based upon this idea which adapts a state aggregation approximation architecture on-line.   Assuming $S$ states, we demonstrate theoretically that - provided the following relatively non-restrictive assumptions are satisfied: (a) the number of cells $X$ in the state aggregation architecture is of order $\sqrt{S}\ln{S}\log_2{S}$ or greater, (b) the policy and transition function are close to deterministic, and (c) the prior for the transition function is uniformly distributed - our algorithm can guarantee, assuming we use an appropriate scoring function to measure VF error, error which is arbitrarily close to zero as $S$ becomes large. It is able to do this despite having only $O(X\log_2{S})$ space complexity (and negligible time complexity). We conclude by generating a set of empirical results which support the theoretical results.|use reinforc learn rl algorithm evalu polici common given larg state space introduc form approxim architectur valu function vf exact form architectur signific effect accuraci vf estim howev determin suitabl approxim architectur often high complex task consequ larg amount interest potenti allow rl algorithm adapt generat learn approxim architectur investig method adapt approxim architectur use feedback regard frequenc agent visit certain state guid area state space approxim greater detail introduc algorithm base upon idea adapt state aggreg approxim architectur line assum state demonstr theoret provid follow relat non restrict assumpt satisfi number cell state aggreg architectur order sqrt ln log greater polici transit function close determinist prior transit function uniform distribut algorithm guarante assum use appropri score function measur vf error error arbitrarili close zero becom larg abl despit onli log space complex neglig time complex conclud generat set empir result support theoret result|['Edward Barker', 'Charl Ras']|['cs.LG', 'cs.AI', 'stat.ML']

The new class of $s$-concave distributions is a broad and natural generalization of log-concavity, and includes many important additional distributions, e.g., the Pareto distribution and $t$-distribution. This class has been studied in the context of efficient sampling, integration, and optimization, but much remains unknown concerning the geometry of this class of distributions and their applications in the context of learning.   The challenge is that unlike the commonly used distributions in learning (uniform or more generally log-concave distributions), this broader class is not closed under the marginalization operator and many such distributions are fat-tailed. In this work, we introduce new convex geometry tools to study the properties of s-concave distributions and use these properties to provide bounds on quantities of interest to learning including the probability of disagreement between two halfspaces, disagreement outside a band, and disagreement coefficient. We use these results to significantly generalize prior results for margin-based active learning, disagreement-based active learning, and passively learning of intersections of halfspaces.   Our analysis of geometric properties of s-concave distributions might be of independent interest to optimization more broadly.|provid new result concern nois toler sampl effici learn algorithm concav distribut mathbb frac le le new class concav distribut broad natur general log concav includ mani import addit distribut pareto distribut distribut class studi context effici sampl integr optim much remain unknown concern geometri class distribut applic context learn challeng unlik common use distribut learn uniform general log concav distribut broader class close margin oper mani distribut fat tail work introduc new convex geometri tool studi properti concav distribut use properti provid bound quantiti interest learn includ probabl disagr two halfspac disagr outsid band disagr coeffici use result signific general prior result margin base activ learn disagr base activ learn passiv learn intersect halfspac analysi geometr properti concav distribut might independ interest optim broad|['Maria-Florina Balcan', 'Hongyang Zhang']|['stat.ML', 'cs.AI', 'cs.LG']

Recently, two competing approaches for automatic program learning have received significant attention: (1) neural program synthesis, where a neural network is conditioned on input/output (I/O) examples and learns to generate a program, and (2) neural program induction, where a neural network generates new outputs directly using a latent program representation.   Here, for the first time, we directly compare both approaches on a large-scale, real-world learning task. We additionally contrast to rule-based program synthesis, which uses hand-crafted semantics to guide the program generation. Our neural models use a modified attention RNN to allow encoding of variable-sized sets of I/O pairs. Our best synthesis model achieves 92% accuracy on a real-world test set, compared to the 34% accuracy of the previous best neural synthesis approach. The synthesis model also outperforms a comparable induction model on this task, but we more importantly demonstrate that the strength of each approach is highly dependent on the evaluation metric and end-user application. Finally, we show that we can train our neural models to remain very robust to the type of noise expected in real-world data (e.g., typos), while a highly-engineered rule-based system fails entirely.|problem automat generat comput program specif studi sinc earli day ai recent two compet approach automat program learn receiv signific attent neural program synthesi neural network condit input output exampl learn generat program neural program induct neural network generat new output direct use latent program represent first time direct compar approach larg scale real world learn task addit contrast rule base program synthesi use hand craft semant guid program generat neural model use modifi attent rnn allow encod variabl size set pair best synthesi model achiev accuraci real world test set compar accuraci previous best neural synthesi approach synthesi model also outperform compar induct model task import demonstr strength approach high depend evalu metric end user applic final show train neural model remain veri robust type nois expect real world data typo high engin rule base system fail entir|['Jacob Devlin', 'Jonathan Uesato', 'Surya Bhupatiraju', 'Rishabh Singh', 'Abdel-rahman Mohamed', 'Pushmeet Kohli']|['cs.AI']

Decades of research with stochastic search techniques has shown the benefit of explicitly modeling the interactions between sets of parameters and the overall quality of the solutions discovered. We demonstrate a novel method, based on learning deep networks, to model the global landscapes of optimization problems. To represent the search space concisely and accurately, the deep networks must encode information about the underlying parameter interactions and their contributions to the quality of the solution. Once the networks are trained, the networks are probed to reveal parameter combinations with high expected performance with respect to the optimization task. These estimates are used to initialize fast, randomized, local search algorithms, which in turn expose more information about the search space that is subsequently used to refine the models. We demonstrate the technique on multiple optimization problems that have arisen in a variety of real-world domains, including: packing, graphics, job scheduling, layout and compression.

This usually requires either careful feature engineering, or a significant number of samples. This is far from what we desire: ideally, robots should be able to learn from very few demonstrations of any given task, and instantly generalize to new situations of the same task, without requiring task-specific engineering. In this paper, we propose a meta-learning framework for achieving such capability, which we call one-shot imitation learning.   Specifically, we consider the setting where there is a very large set of tasks, and each task has many instantiations. For example, a task could be to stack all blocks on a table into a single tower, another task could be to place all blocks on a table into two-block towers, etc. In each case, different instances of the task would consist of different sets of blocks with different initial states. At training time, our algorithm is presented with pairs of demonstrations for a subset of all tasks. A neural net is trained that takes as input one demonstration and the current state (which initially is the initial state of the other demonstration of the pair), and outputs an action with the goal that the resulting sequence of states and actions matches as closely as possible with the second demonstration. At test time, a demonstration of a single instance of a new task is presented, and the neural net is expected to perform well on new instances of this new task. The use of soft attention allows the model to generalize to conditions and tasks unseen in the training data. We anticipate that by training this model on a much greater variety of tasks and settings, we will obtain a general system that can turn any demonstrations into robust policies that can accomplish an overwhelming variety of tasks.

A holy-grail solution towards generic image manipulation should be able to efficiently alter an input image with any personalized signals (even signals unseen during training), such as diverse paintings and arbitrary descriptive attributes. However, existing methods are either inefficient to simultaneously process multiple signals (let alone generalize to unseen signals), or unable to handle signals from other modalities. In this paper, we make the first attempt to address the zero-shot image manipulation task. We cast this problem as manipulating an input image according to a parametric model whose key parameters can be conditionally generated from any guiding signal (even unseen ones). To this end, we propose the Zero-shot Manipulation Net (ZM-Net), a fully-differentiable architecture that jointly optimizes an image-transformation network (TNet) and a parameter network (PNet). The PNet learns to generate key transformation parameters for the TNet given any guiding signal while the TNet performs fast zero-shot image manipulation according to both signal-dependent parameters from the PNet and signal-invariant parameters from the TNet itself. Extensive experiments show that our ZM-Net can perform high-quality image manipulation conditioned on different forms of guiding signals (e.g. style images and attributes) in real-time (tens of milliseconds per image) even for unseen signals.

Existing image description methods are largely restricted by small sets of biased visual paragraph annotations, and fail to cover rich underlying semantics. In this paper, we investigate a semi-supervised paragraph generative framework that is able to synthesize diverse and semantically coherent paragraph descriptions by reasoning over local semantic regions and exploiting linguistic knowledge. The proposed Recurrent Topic-Transition Generative Adversarial Network (RTT-GAN) builds an adversarial framework between a structured paragraph generator and multi-level paragraph discriminators. The paragraph generator generates sentences recurrently by incorporating region-based visual and language attention mechanisms at each step. The quality of generated paragraph sentences is assessed by multi-level adversarial discriminators from two aspects, namely, plausibility at sentence level and topic-transition coherence at paragraph level. The joint adversarial training of RTT-GAN drives the model to generate realistic paragraphs with smooth logical transition between sentence topics. Extensive quantitative experiments on image and video paragraph datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our RTT-GAN in both supervised and semi-supervised settings. Qualitative results on telling diverse stories for an image also verify the interpretability of RTT-GAN.|natur imag usual convey rich semant content view differ angl exist imag descript method larg restrict small set bias visual paragraph annot fail cover rich semant paper investig semi supervis paragraph generat framework abl synthes divers semant coher paragraph descript reason local semant region exploit linguist knowledg propos recurr topic transit generat adversari network rtt gan build adversari framework structur paragraph generat multi level paragraph discrimin paragraph generat generat sentenc recurr incorpor region base visual languag attent mechan step qualiti generat paragraph sentenc assess multi level adversari discrimin two aspect name plausibl sentenc level topic transit coher paragraph level joint adversari train rtt gan drive model generat realist paragraph smooth logic transit sentenc topic extens quantit experi imag video paragraph dataset demonstr effect rtt gan supervis semi supervis set qualit result tell divers stori imag also verifi interpret rtt gan|['Xiaodan Liang', 'Zhiting Hu', 'Hao Zhang', 'Chuang Gan', 'Eric P.

Even though several approaches have been proposed to quantify and preserve privacy in such problems, none of them is exempt from limitations. Here we approach the problem by assuming that computation is performed among utilitarian agents. We introduce a utilitarian approach where the utility of each state is estimated as the difference between the reward for reaching an agreement on assignments of shared variables and the cost of privacy loss. We investigate extensions to solvers where agents integrate the utility function to guide their search and decide which action to perform, defining thereby their policy. We show that these extended solvers succeed in significantly reducing privacy loss without significant degradation of the solution quality.|privaci tradit major motiv distribut problem solv distribut constraint satisfact problem discsp well distribut constraint optim problem dcop fundament model use solv various famili distribut problem even though sever approach propos quantifi preserv privaci problem none exempt limit approach problem assum comput perform among utilitarian agent introduc utilitarian approach util state estim differ reward reach agreement assign share variabl cost privaci loss investig extens solver agent integr util function guid search decid action perform defin therebi polici show extend solver succeed signific reduc privaci loss without signific degrad solut qualiti|['Julien Savaux', 'Julien Vion', 'Sylvain Piechowiak', 'René Mandiau', 'Toshihiro Matsui', 'Katsutoshi Hirayama', 'Makoto Yokoo', 'Shakre Elmane', 'Marius Silaghi']|['cs.AI']

We first introduce a boosting-based approach to learn a correspondence structure which indicates the patch-wise matching probabilities between images from a target camera pair. The learned correspondence structure can not only capture the spatial correspondence pattern between cameras but also handle the viewpoint or human-pose variation in individual images. We further introduce a global constraint-based matching process. It integrates a global matching constraint over the learned correspondence structure to exclude cross-view misalignments during the image patch matching process, hence achieving a more reliable matching score between images. Finally, we also extend our approach by introducing a multi-structure scheme, which learns a set of local correspondence structures to capture the spatial correspondence sub-patterns between a camera pair, so as to handle the spatial misalignments between individual images in a more precise way.

To that end, we are guided by how physicists constructed quantum theory for microscopic entities, which unlike classical objects cannot be fully represented in our spatial theater. We suggest that a similar construction needs to be carried out by linguists and computational scientists, to capture the full meaning content of collections of documental entities. More precisely, we show how to associate a quantum-like 'entity of meaning' to a 'language entity formed by printed documents', considering the latter as the collection of traces that are left by the former, in specific results of search actions that we describe as measurements. In other words, we offer a perspective where a collection of documents, like the Web, is described as the space of manifestation of a more complex entity - the QWeb - which is the object of our modeling, drawing its inspiration from previous studies on operational-realistic approaches to quantum physics and quantum modeling of human cognition and decision-making. We emphasize that a consistent QWeb model needs to account for the observed correlations between words appearing in printed documents, e.g., co-occurrences, as the latter would depend on the 'meaning connections' existing between the concepts that are associated with these words. In that respect, we show that both 'context and interference (quantum) effects' are required to explain the probabilities calculated by counting the relative number of documents containing certain words and co-ocurrrences of words.|elabor quantum model corpora written document like page form world wide web end guid physicist construct quantum theori microscop entiti unlik classic object cannot fulli repres spatial theater suggest similar construct need carri linguist comput scientist captur full mean content collect document entiti precis show associ quantum like entiti mean languag entiti form print document consid latter collect trace left former specif result search action describ measur word offer perspect collect document like web describ space manifest complex entiti qweb object model draw inspir previous studi oper realist approach quantum physic quantum model human cognit decis make emphas consist qweb model need account observ correl word appear print document co occurr latter would depend mean connect exist concept associ word respect show context interfer quantum effect requir explain probabl calcul count relat number document contain certain word co ocurrr word|['Diederik Aerts', 'Jonito Aerts Arguelles', 'Lester Beltran', 'Lyneth Beltran', 'Isaac Distrito', 'Massimiliano Sassoli de Bianchi', 'Sandro Sozzo', 'Tomas Veloz']|['cs.AI', 'cs.CL', 'quant-ph']

Specifically, we pose a cooperative 'image guessing' game between two agents -- Qbot and Abot -- who communicate in natural language dialog so that Qbot can select an unseen image from a lineup of images. We use deep reinforcement learning (RL) to learn the policies of these agents end-to-end -- from pixels to multi-agent multi-round dialog to game reward.   We demonstrate two experimental results.   First, as a 'sanity check' demonstration of pure RL (from scratch), we show results on a synthetic world, where the agents communicate in ungrounded vocabulary, i.e., symbols with no pre-specified meanings (X, Y, Z). We find that two bots invent their own communication protocol and start using certain symbols to ask/answer about certain visual attributes (shape/color/style). Thus, we demonstrate the emergence of grounded language and communication among 'visual' dialog agents with no human supervision.   Second, we conduct large-scale real-image experiments on the VisDial dataset, where we pretrain with supervised dialog data and show that the RL 'fine-tuned' agents significantly outperform SL agents. Interestingly, the RL Qbot learns to ask questions that Abot is good at, ultimately resulting in more informative dialog and a better team.|introduc first goal driven train visual question answer dialog agent specif pose cooper imag guess game two agent qbot abot communic natur languag dialog qbot select unseen imag lineup imag use deep reinforc learn rl learn polici agent end end pixel multi agent multi round dialog game reward demonstr two experiment result first saniti check demonstr pure rl scratch show result synthet world agent communic unground vocabulari symbol pre specifi mean find two bot invent communic protocol start use certain symbol ask answer certain visual attribut shape color style thus demonstr emerg ground languag communic among visual dialog agent human supervis second conduct larg scale real imag experi visdial dataset pretrain supervis dialog data show rl fine tune agent signific outperform sl agent interest rl qbot learn ask question abot good ultim result inform dialog better team|['Abhishek Das', 'Satwik Kottur', 'José M.

However, big-data environments, where soft (i.e., human or human-based) sources are commonly utilized in addition to hard (i.e., physics-based sensors, pose several challenges to traditional conditioning tasks primarily due to the numerous data/source imperfections that are characteristic of such data. The objective of this paper is to investigate the most natural extension of Bayes conditioning based evidence updates in the presence of such large-scale data uncertainties and source/sensor imperfections. By viewing the evidence updating process as a thought experiment, we devise an elegant strategy for robust evidence updating in the presence of extreme uncertainties characteristic of big-data environments. In particular, we look at the formulation of a belief theoretic evidence updating mechanism that is derived as a natural extension of Bayes conditional approach when the incoming evidence takes the form of a general belief function. Proposed method generalizes the belief theoretic Fagin-Halpern conditional notion, and provides a novel evidence updating strategy that is derived as a natural extension of Bayes conditional applied in a highly uncertain and complex fusion scenario that is characteristic of big-data environments. The presented extension differs fundamentally from the previously published work on Conditional Update Equation (CUE) as well as authors own work.

Recently, semantic segmentation of RGB imagery has advanced significantly due to deep learning. Because creating datasets for semantic segmentation is laborious, these datasets tend to be significantly smaller than object recognition datasets. This makes it difficult to directly train a deep neural network for semantic segmentation, because it will be prone to overfitting. To cope with this, deep learning models typically use convolutional neural networks pre-trained on large-scale image classification datasets, which are then fine-tuned for semantic segmentation. For non-RGB imagery, this is currently not possible because large-scale labeled non-RGB datasets do not exist. In this paper, we developed two deep neural networks for semantic segmentation of multispectral remote sensing imagery. Prior to training on the target dataset, we initialize the networks with large amounts of synthetic multispectral imagery. We show that this significantly improves results on real-world remote sensing imagery, and we establish a new state-of-the-art result on the challenging Hamlin Beach State Park Dataset.|semant segment algorithm must assign label everi pixel imag recent semant segment rgb imageri advanc signific due deep learn becaus creat dataset semant segment labori dataset tend signific smaller object recognit dataset make difficult direct train deep neural network semant segment becaus prone overfit cope deep learn model typic use convolut neural network pre train larg scale imag classif dataset fine tune semant segment non rgb imageri current possibl becaus larg scale label non rgb dataset exist paper develop two deep neural network semant segment multispectr remot sens imageri prior train target dataset initi network larg amount synthet multispectr imageri show signific improv result real world remot sens imageri establish new state art result challeng hamlin beach state park dataset|['Ronald Kemker', 'Christopher Kanan']|['cs.CV', 'cs.AI']

Pedestrian detection is a highly researched topic with mature methods, but most datasets focus on common scenes of people engaged in typical walking poses on sidewalks. But performance is most crucial for dangerous scenarios, such as children playing in the street or people using bicycles/skateboards in unexpected ways. Such ""in-the-tail"" data is notoriously hard to observe, making both training and testing difficult. To analyze this problem, we have collected a novel annotated dataset of dangerous scenarios called the Precarious Pedestrian dataset. Even given a dedicated collection effort, it is relatively small by contemporary standards (around 1000 images). To explore large-scale data-driven learning, we explore the use of synthetic data generated by a game engine. A significant challenge is selected the right ""priors"" or parameters for synthesis: we would like realistic data with realistic poses and object configurations. Inspired by Generative Adversarial Networks, we generate a massive amount of synthetic data and train a discriminative classifier to select a realistic subset, which we deem Synthetic Imposters. We demonstrate that this pipeline allows one to generate realistic training data by making use of rendering/animation engines. Interestingly, we also demonstrate that such data can be used to rank algorithms, suggesting that Synthetic Imposters can also be used for ""in-the-tail"" validation at test-time, a notoriously difficult challenge for real-world deployment."|autonom vehicl becom everi day realiti high accuraci pedestrian detect paramount practic import pedestrian detect high research topic matur method dataset focus common scene peopl engag typic walk pose sidewalk perform crucial danger scenario children play street peopl use bicycl skateboard unexpect way tail data notori hard observ make train test difficult analyz problem collect novel annot dataset danger scenario call precari pedestrian dataset even given dedic collect effort relat small contemporari standard around imag explor larg scale data driven learn explor use synthet data generat game engin signific challeng select right prior paramet synthesi would like realist data realist pose object configur inspir generat adversari network generat massiv amount synthet data train discrimin classifi select realist subset deem synthet impost demonstr pipelin allow one generat realist train data make use render anim engin interest also demonstr data use rank algorithm suggest synthet impost also use tail valid test time notori difficult challeng real world deploy|['Shiyu Huang', 'Deva Ramanan']|['cs.CV', 'cs.AI']

In this paper we explore the possibility of using one of a growing set of General Video Game AI agents to perform automatic play-testing. This enables a very general approach to game evaluation based on estimating the skill-depth of a game. Agent-based play-testing is computationally expensive, so we compare two simple but efficient optimisation algorithms: the Random Mutation Hill-Climber and the Multi-Armed Bandit Random Mutation Hill-Climber. For the test game we use a space-battle game in order to provide a suitable balance between simulation speed and potential skill-depth. Results show that both algorithms are able to rapidly evolve game versions with significant skill-depth, but that choosing a suitable resampling number is essential in order to combat the effects of noise.|game generalis number paramet may vari order provid instanc game lead veri differ player experi space possibl paramet set seen search space therefor use random mutat hill climb algorithm search method find paramet set induc best game one hardest part approach defin suitabl fit function paper explor possibl use one grow set general video game ai agent perform automat play test enabl veri general approach game evalu base estim skill depth game agent base play test comput expens compar two simpl effici optimis algorithm random mutat hill climber multi arm bandit random mutat hill climber test game use space battl game order provid suitabl balanc simul speed potenti skill depth result show algorithm abl rapid evolv game version signific skill depth choos suitabl resampl number essenti order combat effect nois|['Jialin Liu', 'Julian Togelius', 'Diego Perez-Liebana', 'Simon M.

Historical milestones have been frequently associated with computers matching or outperforming humans in difficult cognitive tasks (e.g. face recognition [2], personality classification [3], driving cars [4], or playing video games [5]), or defeating humans in strategic zero-sum encounters (e.g. Chess [6], Checkers [7], Jeopardy! [8], Poker [9], or Go [10]). In contrast, less attention has been given to developing autonomous machines that establish mutually cooperative relationships with people who may not share the machine's preferences. A main challenge has been that human cooperation does not require sheer computational power, but rather relies on intuition [11], cultural norms [12], emotions and signals [13, 14, 15, 16], and pre-evolved dispositions toward cooperation [17], common-sense mechanisms that are difficult to encode in machines for arbitrary contexts. Here, we combine a state-of-the-art machine-learning algorithm with novel mechanisms for generating and acting on signals to produce a new learning algorithm that cooperates with people and other machines at levels that rival human cooperation in a variety of two-player repeated stochastic games. This is the first general-purpose algorithm that is capable, given a description of a previously unseen game environment, of learning to cooperate with people within short timescales in scenarios previously unanticipated by algorithm designers. This is achieved without complex opponent modeling or higher-order theories of mind, thus showing that flexible, fast, and general human-machine cooperation is computationally achievable using a non-trivial, but ultimately simple, set of algorithmic mechanisms.|sinc alan ture envis artifici intellig ai major drive forc behind technic progress competit human cognit histor mileston frequent associ comput match outperform human difficult cognit task face recognit person classif drive car play video game defeat human strateg zero sum encount chess checker jeopardi poker go contrast less attent given develop autonom machin establish mutual cooper relationship peopl may share machin prefer main challeng human cooper doe requir sheer comput power rather reli intuit cultur norm emot signal pre evolv disposit toward cooper common sens mechan difficult encod machin arbitrari context combin state art machin learn algorithm novel mechan generat act signal produc new learn algorithm cooper peopl machin level rival human cooper varieti two player repeat stochast game first general purpos algorithm capabl given descript previous unseen game environ learn cooper peopl within short timescal scenario previous unanticip algorithm design achiev without complex oppon model higher order theori mind thus show flexibl fast general human machin cooper comput achiev use non trivial ultim simpl set algorithm mechan|['Jacob W.

Learning is challenging in these settings due to local viewpoints of agents, which perceive the world as non-stationary due to concurrently-exploring teammates. Approaches that learn specialized policies for individual tasks face major problems when applied to the real world: not only do agents have to learn and store a distinct policy for each task, but in practice the identity of the task is often non-observable, making these algorithms inapplicable. This paper formalizes and addresses the problem of multi-task multi-agent reinforcement learning under partial observability.

We show that this is a tight bound, as we can find an approximation within a linear factor in three-level networks. We then show that in four-level trees it is NP-hard to approximate the problem within a factor $2^{f(n)}$ for any sublinear function $f$ of the size of the input $n$.

For the first time, to the best of our knowledge, we change this paradigm in an approximate query processing (AQP) context. We make the following observation: the answer to each query reveals some degree of knowledge about the answer to another query because their answers stem from the same underlying distribution that has produced the entire dataset. Exploiting and refining this knowledge should allow us to answer queries more analytically, rather than by reading enormous amounts of raw data. Also, processing more queries should continuously enhance our knowledge of the underlying distribution, and hence lead to increasingly faster response times for future queries.   We call this novel idea---learning from past query answers---Database Learning. We exploit the principle of maximum entropy to produce answers, which are in expectation guaranteed to be more accurate than existing sample-based approximations. Empowered by this idea, we build a query engine on top of Spark SQL, called Verdict. We conduct extensive experiments on real-world query traces from a large customer of a major database vendor. Our results demonstrate that database learning supports 73.7% of these queries, speeding them up by up to 23.0x for the same accuracy level compared to existing AQP systems.|today databas previous queri answer rare benefit answer futur queri first time best knowledg chang paradigm approxim queri process aqp context make follow observ answer queri reveal degre knowledg answer anoth queri becaus answer stem distribut produc entir dataset exploit refin knowledg allow us answer queri analyt rather read enorm amount raw data also process queri continu enhanc knowledg distribut henc lead increas faster respons time futur queri call novel idea learn past queri answer databas learn exploit principl maximum entropi produc answer expect guarante accur exist sampl base approxim empow idea build queri engin top spark sql call verdict conduct extens experi real world queri trace larg custom major databas vendor result demonstr databas learn support queri speed accuraci level compar exist aqp system|['Yongjoo Park', 'Ahmad Shahab Tajik', 'Michael Cafarella', 'Barzan Mozafari']|['cs.DB', 'cs.AI']

Existing algorithms are either heuristics with no guarantees, or scale poorly (with exponential run time in terms of the number of available tests). Moreover, these methods assume a known distribution over the test outcomes, which is often not the case in practice. We propose an efficient sampling-based online learning framework to address the above issues. First, assuming the distribution over hypotheses is known, we propose a dynamic hypothesis enumeration strategy, which allows efficient information gathering with strong theoretical guarantees. We show that with sufficient amount of samples, one can identify a near-optimal decision with high probability. Second, when the parameters of the hypotheses distribution are unknown, we propose an algorithm which learns the parameters progressively via posterior sampling in an online fashion. We further establish a rigorous bound on the expected regret.

Given these rich annotations we perform detailed analyses of the leading human parsing approaches, gaining insights into the success and failures of these methods. Furthermore, in contrast to the existing efforts on improving the feature discriminative capability, we solve human parsing by exploring a novel self-supervised structure-sensitive learning approach, which imposes human pose structures into parsing results without resorting to extra supervision (i.e., no need for specifically labeling human joints in model training). Our self-supervised learning framework can be injected into any advanced neural networks to help incorporate rich high-level knowledge regarding human joints from a global perspective and improve the parsing results.

Instead, some objects might be ranked equally, or better than other objects only to some degree. In such cases, a generalization of crisp rankings to fuzzy rankings can be more useful. The aim of the article is to introduce the notion of a fuzzy ranking and to discuss its several properties, namely orderings, similarity and indecisiveness. The proposed approach can be used both for group decision making or multiple criteria decision making when uncertainty is involved.|practic rank object respect given set criteria consider import howev due lack knowledg inform time pressur decis maker might abl provid crisp rank object top bottom instead object might rank equal better object onli degre case general crisp rank fuzzi rank use aim articl introduc notion fuzzi rank discuss sever properti name order similar indecis propos approach use group decis make multipl criteria decis make uncertainti involv|['Jiří Mazurek']|['cs.AI']

In this study here, we present two new sets of belief change operators for logic programs. They focus on preserving the explicit relationships expressed in the rules of a program, a feature that is missing in purely semantic approaches that consider programs only in their entirety. In particular, operators of the latter class fail to satisfy preservation and support, two important properties for belief change in logic programs required to ensure intuitive results.   We address this shortcoming of existing approaches by introducing partial meet and ensconcement constructions for logic program belief change, which allow us to define syntax-preserving operators that satisfy preservation and support. Our work is novel in that our constructions not only preserve more information from a logic program during a change operation than existing ones, but they also facilitate natural definitions of contraction operators, the first in the field to the best of our knowledge.   In order to evaluate the rationality of our operators, we translate the revision and contraction postulates from the AGM and belief base frameworks to the logic programming setting. We show that our operators fully comply with the belief base framework and formally state the interdefinability between our operators. We further propose an algorithm that is based on modularising a logic program to reduce partial meet and ensconcement revisions or contractions to performing the operation only on the relevant modules of that program. Finally, we compare our approach to two state-of-the-art logic program revision methods and demonstrate that our operators address the shortcomings of one and generalise the other method.|recent method adapt well establish agm belief base framework belief chang cover belief revis logic program studi present two new set belief chang oper logic program focus preserv explicit relationship express rule program featur miss pure semant approach consid program onli entireti particular oper latter class fail satisfi preserv support two import properti belief chang logic program requir ensur intuit result address shortcom exist approach introduc partial meet ensconc construct logic program belief chang allow us defin syntax preserv oper satisfi preserv support work novel construct onli preserv inform logic program dure chang oper exist one also facilit natur definit contract oper first field best knowledg order evalu ration oper translat revis contract postul agm belief base framework logic program set show oper fulli compli belief base framework formal state interdefin oper propos algorithm base modularis logic program reduc partial meet ensconc revis contract perform oper onli relev modul program final compar approach two state art logic program revis method demonstr oper address shortcom one generalis method|['Sebastian Binnewies', 'Zhiqiang Zhuang', 'Kewen Wang', 'Bela Stantic']|['cs.AI', 'I.2.3; I.2.4; F.4.1']

Towards this end, we propose a multi-agent learning environment and learning methods that bring about emergence of a basic compositional language.

To overcome the shortcomings and enhance its capability of representing the uncertainty, a novel model, called D numbers, has been proposed recently. However, many key issues, for example how to implement the combination of D numbers, remain unsolved. In the paper, we have explored the combination of D Numbers from a perspective of conflict redistribution, and proposed two combination rules being suitable for different situations for the fusion of two D numbers.

In this work, we propose a simple heuristic that guided the development of FastQA, an efficient end-to-end neural model for question answering that is very competitive with existing models. We further demonstrate, that an extended version (FastQAExt) achieves state-of-the-art results on recent benchmark datasets, namely SQuAD, NewsQA and MsMARCO, outperforming most existing models. However, we show that increasing the complexity of FastQA to FastQAExt does not yield any systematic improvements. We argue that the same holds true for most existing systems that are similar to FastQAExt. A manual analysis reveals that our proposed heuristic explains most predictions of our model, which indicates that modeling a simple heuristic is enough to achieve strong performance on extractive QA datasets.

To develop a formal framework for desirable weighting schemes, we draw on no-regret learning. Specifically, given a voting rule, we wish to design a weighting scheme such that applying the voting rule, with voters weighted by the scheme, leads to choices that are almost as good as those endorsed by the best voter in hindsight. We derive possibility and impossibility results for the existence of such weighting schemes, depending on whether the voting rule and the weighting scheme are deterministic or randomized, as well as on the social choice axioms satisfied by the voting rule.|vote system typic treat voter equal argu perhap voter support good choic past given higher weight voter support bad one develop formal framework desir weight scheme draw regret learn specif given vote rule wish design weight scheme appli vote rule voter weight scheme lead choic almost good endors best voter hindsight deriv possibl imposs result exist weight scheme depend whether vote rule weight scheme determinist random well social choic axiom satisfi vote rule|['Nika Haghtalab', 'Ritesh Noothigattu', 'Ariel D.

We first discuss different approaches towards the conceptual design of autonomous systems and their implications on the ethics implementation in such systems. Then we examine problematic areas regarding the specification and verification of ethical behavior in autonomous systems, particularly with a view towards the requirements of future legislation. We discuss transparency and accountability issues that will be crucial for any future wide deployment of autonomous systems in society.

In this paper, we use influence functions -- a classic technique from robust statistics -- to trace a model's prediction through the learning algorithm and back to its training data, identifying the points most responsible for a given prediction. Applying ideas from second-order optimization, we scale up influence functions to modern machine learning settings and show that they can be applied to high-dimensional black-box models, even in non-convex and non-differentiable settings. We give a simple, efficient implementation that requires only oracle access to gradients and Hessian-vector products. On linear models and convolutional neural networks, we demonstrate that influence functions are useful for many different purposes: to understand model behavior, debug models and detect dataset errors, and even identify and exploit vulnerabilities to adversarial training-set attacks.|explain predict black box model paper use influenc function classic techniqu robust statist trace model predict learn algorithm back train data identifi point respons given predict appli idea second order optim scale influenc function modern machin learn set show appli high dimension black box model even non convex non differenti set give simpl effici implement requir onli oracl access gradient hessian vector product linear model convolut neural network demonstr influenc function use mani differ purpos understand model behavior debug model detect dataset error even identifi exploit vulner adversari train set attack|['Pang Wei Koh', 'Percy Liang']|['stat.ML', 'cs.AI', 'cs.LG']

The ACT-R based Lewis & Vasishth 2005 model is used to implement these three proposals. Slowed processing is implemented as slowed default production-rule firing time; intermittent deficiency as increased random noise in activation of chunks in memory; and resource reduction as reduced goal activation. As data, we considered subject vs. object relatives presented in a self-paced listening modality to 56 individuals with aphasia (IWA) and 46 matched controls. The participants heard the sentences and carried out a picture verification task to decide on an interpretation of the sentence. These response accuracies are used to identify the best parameters (for each participant) that correspond to the three hypotheses mentioned above. We show that controls have more tightly clustered (less variable) parameter values than IWA; specifically, compared to controls, among IWA there are more individuals with low goal activations, high noise, and slow default action times. This suggests that (i) individual patients show differential amounts of deficit along the three dimensions of slowed processing, intermittent deficient, and resource reduction, (ii) overall, there is evidence for all three sources of deficit playing a role, and (iii) IWA have a more variable range of parameter values than controls. In sum, this study contributes a proof of concept of a quantitative implementation of, and evidence for, these three accounts of comprehension deficits in aphasia.|present comput evalu three hypothes sourc deficit sentenc comprehens aphasia slow process intermitt defici resourc reduct act base lewi vasishth model use implement three propos slow process implement slow default product rule fire time intermitt defici increas random nois activ chunk memori resourc reduct reduc goal activ data consid subject vs object relat present self pace listen modal individu aphasia iwa match control particip heard sentenc carri pictur verif task decid interpret sentenc respons accuraci use identifi best paramet particip correspond three hypothes mention abov show control tight cluster less variabl paramet valu iwa specif compar control among iwa individu low goal activ high nois slow default action time suggest individu patient show differenti amount deficit along three dimens slow process intermitt defici resourc reduct ii overal evid three sourc deficit play role iii iwa variabl rang paramet valu control sum studi contribut proof concept quantit implement evid three account comprehens deficit aphasia|['Paul Mätzig', 'Shravan Vasishth', 'Felix Engelmann', 'David Caplan']|['cs.CL', 'cs.AI']

Extending previous work in the Bayesian setting, we consider instead a worst-case setting in which the agent has a set of possible environments (MDPs) it could be in, and develop a commitment semantics that allows for probabilistic guarantees on the agent's behavior in any of the environments it could end up facing. Crucially, an agent receives observations (of reward and state transitions) that allow it to potentially eliminate possible environments and thus obtain higher utility by adapting its policy to the history of observations.

Specifically, it is argued that the structure of linguistic syntax can be modeled as a certain asymmetric monoidal category, as e.g. implicit in the link grammar formalism; the structure of spatiotemporal relationships and action plans can be modeled similarly using ""image grammars"" and ""action grammars""; and common-sense logical semantic structure can be modeled using dependently-typed lambda calculus with uncertain truth values.

For example, when applied to image segmentation, the value network takes an image and a segmentation mask as inputs and predicts a scalar score evaluating the mask quality and its correspondence with the image. Once the value network is optimized, at inference, it finds output structures that maximize the score of the value net via gradient descent on continuous relaxations of structured outputs. Thus DVN takes advantage of the joint modeling of the inputs and outputs. Our framework applies to a wide range of structured output prediction problems. We conduct experiments on multi-label classification based on text data and on image segmentation problems. DVN outperforms several strong baselines and the state-of-the-art results on these benchmarks. In addition, on image segmentation, the proposed deep value network learns complex shape priors and effectively combines image information with the prior to obtain competitive segmentation results.|approach structur output predict learn deep valu network dvn evalu differ output structur given input exampl appli imag segment valu network take imag segment mask input predict scalar score evalu mask qualiti correspond imag onc valu network optim infer find output structur maxim score valu net via gradient descent continu relax structur output thus dvn take advantag joint model input output framework appli wide rang structur output predict problem conduct experi multi label classif base text data imag segment problem dvn outperform sever strong baselin state art result benchmark addit imag segment propos deep valu network learn complex shape prior effect combin imag inform prior obtain competit segment result|['Michael Gygli', 'Mohammad Norouzi', 'Anelia Angelova']|['cs.LG', 'cs.AI', 'cs.CV']

Cognitive synergy has been posited as a key feature of real-world general intelligence, and has been used explicitly in the design of the OpenCog cognitive architecture. Here category theory and related concepts are used to give a formalization of the cognitive synergy concept.   A series of formal models of intelligent agents is proposed, with increasing specificity and complexity: simple reinforcement learning agents; ""cognit"" agents with an abstract memory and processing model; hypergraph-based agents (in which ""cognit"" operations are carried out via hypergraphs); hypergraph agents with a rich language of nodes and hyperlinks (such as the OpenCog framework provides); ""PGMC"" agents whose rich hypergraphs are endowed with cognitive processes guided via Probabilistic Growth and Mining of Combinations; and finally variations of the PrimeAGI design, which is currently being built on top of OpenCog.   A notion of cognitive synergy is developed for cognitive processes acting within PGMC agents, based on developing a formal notion of ""stuckness,"" and defining synergy as a relationship between cognitive processes in which they can help each other out when they get stuck. It is proposed that cognitive processes relating to each other synergetically, associate in a certain way with functors that map into each other via natural transformations. Cognitive synergy is proposed to correspond to a certain inequality regarding the relative costs of different paths through certain commutation diagrams.   Applications of this notion of cognitive synergy to particular cognitive phenomena, and specific cognitive processes in the PrimeAGI design, are discussed."|cognit synergi refer dynam multipl cognit process cooper control cognit system assist overcom bottleneck encount dure intern process cognit synergi posit key featur real world general intellig use explicit design opencog cognit architectur categori theori relat concept use give formal cognit synergi concept seri formal model intellig agent propos increas specif complex simpl reinforc learn agent cognit agent abstract memori process model hypergraph base agent cognit oper carri via hypergraph hypergraph agent rich languag node hyperlink opencog framework provid pgmc agent whose rich hypergraph endow cognit process guid via probabilist growth mine combin final variat primeagi design current built top opencog notion cognit synergi develop cognit process act within pgmc agent base develop formal notion stuck defin synergi relationship cognit process help get stuck propos cognit process relat synerget associ certain way functor map via natur transform cognit synergi propos correspond certain inequ regard relat cost differ path certain commut diagram applic notion cognit synergi particular cognit phenomena specif cognit process primeagi design discuss|['Ben Goertzel']|['cs.AI']

In addition, it is required that each state on the trajectory induced by the execution of plans complies with a given set of global constraints. We approach the computation of plans for such domains as the problem of searching over a deterministic state model. In this model, some of the successor states are obtained by solving numerically the so-called initial value problem over a set of ordinary differential equations (ODE) given by the current plan prefix. These equations hold over time intervals whose duration is determined dynamically, according to whether zero crossing events take place for a set of invariant conditions. The resulting planner, FS+, incorporates these features together with effective heuristic guidance. FS+ does not impose any of the syntactic restrictions on process effects often found on the existing literature on Hybrid Planning. A key concept of our approach is that a clear separation is struck between planning and simulation time steps. The former is the time allowed to observe the evolution of a given dynamical system before committing to a future course of action, whilst the later is part of the model of the environment. FS+ is shown to be a robust planner over a diverse set of hybrid domains, taken from the existing literature on hybrid planning and systems.|paper look problem plan hybrid domain chang discret instantan continu time addit requir state trajectori induc execut plan compli given set global constraint approach comput plan domain problem search determinist state model model successor state obtain solv numer call initi valu problem set ordinari differenti equat ode given current plan prefix equat hold time interv whose durat determin dynam accord whether zero cross event take place set invari condit result planner fs incorpor featur togeth effect heurist guidanc fs doe impos ani syntact restrict process effect often found exist literatur hybrid plan key concept approach clear separ struck plan simul time step former time allow observ evolut given dynam system befor commit futur cours action whilst later part model environ fs shown robust planner divers set hybrid domain taken exist literatur hybrid plan system|['Miquel Ramirez', 'Enrico Scala', 'Patrik Haslum', 'Sylvie Thiebaux']|['cs.AI', 'I.2.8; F.2.2; I.6; J.2']

However, a complete cloud resource allocation framework exhibits high dimensions in state and action spaces, which prohibit the usefulness of traditional RL techniques. In addition, high power consumption has become one of the critical concerns in design and control of cloud computing systems, which degrades system reliability and increases cooling cost. An effective dynamic power management (DPM) policy should minimize power consumption while maintaining performance degradation within an acceptable level. Thus, a joint virtual machine (VM) resource allocation and power management framework is critical to the overall cloud computing system. Moreover, novel solution framework is necessary to address the even higher dimensions in state and action spaces. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical framework for solving the overall resource allocation and power management problem in cloud computing systems. The proposed hierarchical framework comprises a global tier for VM resource allocation to the servers and a local tier for distributed power management of local servers. The emerging deep reinforcement learning (DRL) technique, which can deal with complicated control problems with large state space, is adopted to solve the global tier problem. Furthermore, an autoencoder and a novel weight sharing structure are adopted to handle the high-dimensional state space and accelerate the convergence speed. On the other hand, the local tier of distributed server power managements comprises an LSTM based workload predictor and a model-free RL based power manager, operating in a distributed manner.|automat decis make approach reinforc learn rl appli partial solv resourc alloc problem adapt cloud comput system howev complet cloud resourc alloc framework exhibit high dimens state action space prohibit use tradit rl techniqu addit high power consumpt becom one critic concern design control cloud comput system degrad system reliabl increas cool cost effect dynam power manag dpm polici minim power consumpt maintain perform degrad within accept level thus joint virtual machin vm resourc alloc power manag framework critic overal cloud comput system moreov novel solut framework necessari address even higher dimens state action space paper propos novel hierarch framework solv overal resourc alloc power manag problem cloud comput system propos hierarch framework compris global tier vm resourc alloc server local tier distribut power manag local server emerg deep reinforc learn drl techniqu deal complic control problem larg state space adopt solv global tier problem furthermor autoencod novel weight share structur adopt handl high dimension state space acceler converg speed hand local tier distribut server power manag compris lstm base workload predictor model free rl base power manag oper distribut manner|['Ning Liu', 'Zhe Li', 'Zhiyuan Xu', 'Jielong Xu', 'Sheng Lin', 'Qinru Qiu', 'Jian Tang', 'Yanzhi Wang']|['cs.DC', 'cs.AI']

Agents' workspace is tessellated into the square grid on which any-angle moves are allowed, e.g. each agent can move into an arbitrary direction as long as this move follows the straight line segment whose endpoints are tied to the distinct grid elements. A novel any-angle planner based on Safe Interval Path Planning (SIPP) algorithm is proposed to find trajectories for an agent moving amidst dynamic obstacles (other agents) on a grid. This algorithm is then used as part of a prioritized multi-agent planner AA-SIPP(m). On the theoretical, side we show that AA-SIPP(m) is complete under well-defined conditions. On the experimental side, in simulation tests with up to 200 agents involved, we show that our planner finds much better solutions in terms of cost (up to 20%) compared to the planners relying on cardinal moves only.|problem find conflict free trajectori multipl agent ident circular shape oper share workspac address paper decoupl priorit approach use solv problem agent workspac tessel squar grid ani angl move allow agent move arbitrari direct long move follow straight line segment whose endpoint tie distinct grid element novel ani angl planner base safe interv path plan sipp algorithm propos find trajectori agent move amidst dynam obstacl agent grid algorithm use part priorit multi agent planner aa sipp theoret side show aa sipp complet well defin condit experiment side simul test agent involv show planner find much better solut term cost compar planner reli cardin move onli|['Konstantin Yakovlev', 'Anton Andreychuk']|['cs.AI']

No accuracy drop on image classification is observed on these extremely compact networks, compared to well-known models. An emerging question, however, is whether these model compression techniques hurt DNN's learning ability other than classifying images on a single dataset. Our preliminary experiment shows that these compression methods could degrade domain adaptation (DA) ability, though the classification performance is preserved. Therefore, we propose a new compact network architecture and unsupervised DA method in this paper. The DNN is built on a new basic module Conv-M which provides more diverse feature extractors without significantly increasing parameters. The unified framework of our DA method will simultaneously learn invariance across domains, reduce divergence of feature representations, and adapt label prediction. Our DNN has 4.1M parameters, which is only 6.7% of AlexNet or 59% of GoogLeNet. Experiments show that our DNN obtains GoogLeNet-level accuracy both on classification and DA, and our DA method slightly outperforms previous competitive ones. Put all together, our DA strategy based on our DNN achieves state-of-the-art on sixteen of total eighteen DA tasks on popular Office-31 and Office-Caltech datasets.|recent dnn model compress base network architectur design squeezenet attract lot attent accuraci drop imag classif observ extrem compact network compar well known model emerg question howev whether model compress techniqu hurt dnn learn abil classifi imag singl dataset preliminari experi show compress method could degrad domain adapt da abil though classif perform preserv therefor propos new compact network architectur unsupervis da method paper dnn built new basic modul conv provid divers featur extractor without signific increas paramet unifi framework da method simultan learn invari across domain reduc diverg featur represent adapt label predict dnn paramet onli alexnet googlenet experi show dnn obtain googlenet level accuraci classif da da method slight outperform previous competit one put togeth da strategi base dnn achiev state art sixteen total eighteen da task popular offic offic caltech dataset|['Chunpeng Wu', 'Wei Wen', 'Tariq Afzal', 'Yongmei Zhang', 'Yiran Chen', 'Hai Li']|['cs.CV', 'cs.AI', 'cs.NE']

However, discovering subgoals online is too expensive to be used to learn options in large state spaces. We propose Micro-objective learning (MOL) to solve this problem. The main idea is to estimate how important a state is while training and to give an additional reward proportional to its importance.
