We propose to use a pretrained convnet feature, a concatenated feature vector using activations of feature maps of multiple layers in a trained convolutional network. We show that how this convnet feature can serve as a general-purpose music representation. In the experiment, a convnet is trained for music tagging and then transferred for many music-related classification and regression tasks as well as an audio-related classification task. In experiments, the convnet feature outperforms the baseline MFCC feature in all tasks and many reported approaches of aggregating MFCCs and low- and high-level music features.|paper present transfer learn approach music classif regress task propos use pretrain convnet featur concaten featur vector use activ featur map multipl layer train convolut network show convnet featur serv general purpos music represent experi convnet train music tag transfer mani music relat classif regress task well audio relat classif task experi convnet featur outperform baselin mfcc featur task mani report approach aggreg mfccs low high level music featur|['Keunwoo Choi', 'Gy√∂rgy Fazekas', 'Mark Sandler', 'Kyunghyun Cho']|['cs.CV', 'cs.AI', 'cs.MM', 'cs.SD']

Recently, a variant of RRT called RRT* has been proposed that ensures asymptotic optimality. Subsequently its bidirectional version has also been introduced in the literature known as Bidirectional-RRT* (B-RRT*). We introduce a new variant called Intelligent Bidirectional-RRT* (IB-RRT*) which is an improved variant of the optimal RRT* and bidirectional version of RRT* (B-RRT*) algorithms and is specially designed for complex cluttered environments. IB-RRT* utilizes the bidirectional trees approach and introduces intelligent sample insertion heuristic for fast convergence to the optimal path solution using uniform sampling heuristics. The proposed algorithm is evaluated theoretically and experimental results are presented that compares IB-RRT* with RRT* and B-RRT*. Moreover, experimental results demonstrate the superior efficiency of IB-RRT* in comparison with RRT* and B-RRT in complex cluttered environments.|sampl base motion plan algorithm known rapid explor random tree rrt gain attent mani research due comput effici effect recent variant rrt call rrt propos ensur asymptot optim subsequ bidirect version also introduc literatur known bidirect rrt rrt introduc new variant call intellig bidirect rrt ib rrt improv variant optim rrt bidirect version rrt rrt algorithm special design complex clutter environ ib rrt util bidirect tree approach introduc intellig sampl insert heurist fast converg optim path solut use uniform sampl heurist propos algorithm evalu theoret experiment result present compar ib rrt rrt rrt moreov experiment result demonstr superior effici ib rrt comparison rrt rrt complex clutter environ|['Ahmed Hussain Qureshi', 'Yasar Ayaz']|['cs.RO', 'cs.AI']

The goal in this paper is to automate $\mathcal{DDE}$. We briefly present $\mathcal{DDE}$, and use a first-order modal logic, the deontic cognitive event calculus, as our framework to formalize the doctrine. We present formalizations of increasingly stronger versions of the principle, including what is known as the doctrine of triple effect. We then use our framework to simulate successfully scenarios that have been used to test for the presence of the principle in human subjects. Our framework can be used in two different modes: One can use it to build $\mathcal{DDE}$-compliant autonomous systems from scratch, or one can use it to verify that a given AI system is $\mathcal{DDE}$-compliant, by applying a $\mathcal{DDE}$ layer on an existing system or model. For the latter mode, the underlying AI system can be built using any architecture (planners, deep neural networks, bayesian networks, knowledge-representation systems, or a hybrid); as long as the system exposes a few parameters in its model, such verification is possible. The role of the $\mathcal{DDE}$ layer here is akin to a (dynamic or static) software verifier that examines existing software modules. Finally, we end by presenting initial work on how one can apply our $\mathcal{DDE}$ layer to the STRIPS-style planning model, and to a modified POMDP model.|doctrin doubl effect mathcal dde long studi ethic principl govern action posit negat effect allow goal paper autom mathcal dde briefli present mathcal dde use first order modal logic deontic cognit event calculus framework formal doctrin present formal increas stronger version principl includ known doctrin tripl effect use framework simul success scenario use test presenc principl human subject framework use two differ mode one use build mathcal dde compliant autonom system scratch one use verifi given ai system mathcal dde compliant appli mathcal dde layer exist system model latter mode ai system built use ani architectur planner deep neural network bayesian network knowledg represent system hybrid long system expos paramet model verif possibl role mathcal dde layer akin dynam static softwar verifi examin exist softwar modul final end present initi work one appli mathcal dde layer strip style plan model modifi pomdp model|['Naveen Sundar Govindarajulu', 'Selmer Bringsjord']|['cs.AI', 'cs.LO', 'cs.RO']

However, while instinctive to humans, socially compliant navigation is still difficult to quantify due to the stochasticity in people's behaviors. Existing works are mostly focused on using feature-matching techniques to describe and imitate human paths, but often do not generalize well since the feature values can vary from person to person, and even run to run. This work notes that while it is challenging to directly specify the details of what to do (precise mechanisms of human navigation), it is straightforward to specify what not to do (violations of social norms). Specifically, using deep reinforcement learning, this work develops a time-efficient navigation policy that respects common social norms. The proposed method is shown to enable fully autonomous navigation of a robotic vehicle moving at human walking speed in an environment with many pedestrians.|robot vehicl navig safe effici pedestrian rich environ import model subtl human behavior navig rule howev instinct human social compliant navig still difficult quantifi due stochast peopl behavior exist work focus use featur match techniqu describ imit human path often general well sinc featur valu vari person person even run run work note challeng direct specifi detail precis mechan human navig straightforward specifi violat social norm specif use deep reinforc learn work develop time effici navig polici respect common social norm propos method shown enabl fulli autonom navig robot vehicl move human walk speed environ mani pedestrian|['Yu Fan Chen', 'Michael Everett', 'Miao Liu', 'Jonathan P.

Patient phenotyping is a classification task for determining whether a patient has a medical condition, and is a crucial part of secondary analysis of healthcare data. We assess the performance of deep learning algorithms and compare them with classical NLP approaches.   Materials and Methods: We compare convolutional neural networks (CNNs), n-gram models, and approaches based on cTAKES that extract pre-defined medical concepts from clinical notes and use them to predict patient phenotypes. The performance is tested on 10 different phenotyping tasks using 1,610 discharge summaries extracted from the MIMIC-III database.   Results: CNNs outperform other phenotyping algorithms in all 10 tasks. The average F1-score of our model is 76 (PPV of 83, and sensitivity of 71) with our model having an F1-score up to 37 points higher than alternative approaches. We additionally assess the interpretability of our model by presenting a method that extracts the most salient phrases for a particular prediction.   Conclusion: We show that NLP methods based on deep learning improve the performance of patient phenotyping. Our CNN-based algorithm automatically learns the phrases associated with each patient phenotype. As such, it reduces the annotation complexity for clinical domain experts, who are normally required to develop task-specific annotation rules and identify relevant phrases. Our method performs well in terms of both performance and interpretability, which indicates that deep learning is an effective approach to patient phenotyping based on clinicians' notes.|object investig whether deep learn techniqu natur languag process nlp use effici patient phenotyp patient phenotyp classif task determin whether patient medic condit crucial part secondari analysi healthcar data assess perform deep learn algorithm compar classic nlp approach materi method compar convolut neural network cnns gram model approach base ctake extract pre defin medic concept clinic note use predict patient phenotyp perform test differ phenotyp task use discharg summari extract mimic iii databas result cnns outperform phenotyp algorithm task averag score model ppv sensit model score point higher altern approach addit assess interpret model present method extract salient phrase particular predict conclus show nlp method base deep learn improv perform patient phenotyp cnn base algorithm automat learn phrase associ patient phenotyp reduc annot complex clinic domain expert normal requir develop task specif annot rule identifi relev phrase method perform well term perform interpret indic deep learn effect approach patient phenotyp base clinician note|['Sebastian Gehrmann', 'Franck Dernoncourt', 'Yeran Li', 'Eric T.

To make our Gaussian assumption reasonable, the IMM procedure utilizes various transfer learning techniques including weight transfer, L2-norm of old and new parameters, and a newly proposed variant of dropout using old parameters. We analyze our methods on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, and then evaluate them on a real-world life-log dataset collected using Google Glass.

Traditional POMDP planning problems target to find the optimal policy to maximize the expectation of accumulated rewards. But for safety critical applications, guarantees of system performance described by formal specifications are desired, which motivates us to consider formal methods to synthesize supervisor for POMDP.

Based on observations that the pitch context and onset score times are influential on the configuration of note values, we construct a context-tree model that provides prior distributions of note values using these features and combine it with a performance model in the framework of Markov random fields. Evaluation results showed that our method reduces the average error rate by around 40 percent compared to existing/simple methods.

This has given rise to three families of formalisms: guarded, non-recursive, and sticky sets of tgds. In this work, we study the containment problem for OMQs expressed in such formalisms, which is a key ingredient for solving static analysis tasks associated with them.

However, the best-known methods (e.g., Katyusha) requires at least two auxiliary variables and two momentum parameters. In this paper, we propose a fast stochastic variance reduction gradient (FSVRG) method, in which we design a novel update rule with the Nesterov's momentum and incorporate the technique of growing epoch size. FSVRG has only one auxiliary variable and one momentum weight, and thus it is much simpler and has much lower per-iteration complexity. We prove that FSVRG achieves linear convergence for strongly convex problems and the optimal $\mathcal{O}(1/T^2)$ convergence rate for non-strongly convex problems, where $T$ is the number of outer-iterations. We also extend FSVRG to directly solve the problems with non-smooth component functions, such as SVM. Finally, we empirically study the performance of FSVRG for solving various machine learning problems such as logistic regression, ridge regression, Lasso and SVM. Our results show that FSVRG outperforms the state-of-the-art stochastic methods, including Katyusha.|recent research acceler stochast gradient descent method svrg made excit progress linear converg strong convex problem howev best known method katyusha requir least two auxiliari variabl two momentum paramet paper propos fast stochast varianc reduct gradient fsvrg method design novel updat rule nesterov momentum incorpor techniqu grow epoch size fsvrg onli one auxiliari variabl one momentum weight thus much simpler much lower per iter complex prove fsvrg achiev linear converg strong convex problem optim mathcal converg rate non strong convex problem number outer iter also extend fsvrg direct solv problem non smooth compon function svm final empir studi perform fsvrg solv various machin learn problem logist regress ridg regress lasso svm result show fsvrg outperform state art stochast method includ katyusha|['Fanhua Shang', 'Yuanyuan Liu', 'James Cheng', 'Jiacheng Zhuo']|['cs.LG', 'cs.AI', 'math.OC', 'stat.ML']

The exact form of this architecture can have a significant effect on the accuracy of the VF estimate, however, and determining a suitable approximation architecture can often be a highly complex task. Consequently there is a large amount of interest in the potential for allowing RL algorithms to adaptively generate (i.e. to learn) approximation architectures.   We investigate a method of adapting approximation architectures which uses feedback regarding the frequency with which an agent has visited certain states to guide which areas of the state space to approximate with greater detail. We introduce an algorithm based upon this idea which adapts a state aggregation approximation architecture on-line.   Assuming $S$ states, we demonstrate theoretically that - provided the following relatively non-restrictive assumptions are satisfied: (a) the number of cells $X$ in the state aggregation architecture is of order $\sqrt{S}\ln{S}\log_2{S}$ or greater, (b) the policy and transition function are close to deterministic, and (c) the prior for the transition function is uniformly distributed - our algorithm can guarantee, assuming we use an appropriate scoring function to measure VF error, error which is arbitrarily close to zero as $S$ becomes large. It is able to do this despite having only $O(X\log_2{S})$ space complexity (and negligible time complexity). We conclude by generating a set of empirical results which support the theoretical results.|use reinforc learn rl algorithm evalu polici common given larg state space introduc form approxim architectur valu function vf exact form architectur signific effect accuraci vf estim howev determin suitabl approxim architectur often high complex task consequ larg amount interest potenti allow rl algorithm adapt generat learn approxim architectur investig method adapt approxim architectur use feedback regard frequenc agent visit certain state guid area state space approxim greater detail introduc algorithm base upon idea adapt state aggreg approxim architectur line assum state demonstr theoret provid follow relat non restrict assumpt satisfi number cell state aggreg architectur order sqrt ln log greater polici transit function close determinist prior transit function uniform distribut algorithm guarante assum use appropri score function measur vf error error arbitrarili close zero becom larg abl despit onli log space complex neglig time complex conclud generat set empir result support theoret result|['Edward Barker', 'Charl Ras']|['cs.LG', 'cs.AI', 'stat.ML']

The new class of $s$-concave distributions is a broad and natural generalization of log-concavity, and includes many important additional distributions, e.g., the Pareto distribution and $t$-distribution. This class has been studied in the context of efficient sampling, integration, and optimization, but much remains unknown concerning the geometry of this class of distributions and their applications in the context of learning.   The challenge is that unlike the commonly used distributions in learning (uniform or more generally log-concave distributions), this broader class is not closed under the marginalization operator and many such distributions are fat-tailed. In this work, we introduce new convex geometry tools to study the properties of s-concave distributions and use these properties to provide bounds on quantities of interest to learning including the probability of disagreement between two halfspaces, disagreement outside a band, and disagreement coefficient. We use these results to significantly generalize prior results for margin-based active learning, disagreement-based active learning, and passively learning of intersections of halfspaces.   Our analysis of geometric properties of s-concave distributions might be of independent interest to optimization more broadly.|provid new result concern nois toler sampl effici learn algorithm concav distribut mathbb frac le le new class concav distribut broad natur general log concav includ mani import addit distribut pareto distribut distribut class studi context effici sampl integr optim much remain unknown concern geometri class distribut applic context learn challeng unlik common use distribut learn uniform general log concav distribut broader class close margin oper mani distribut fat tail work introduc new convex geometri tool studi properti concav distribut use properti provid bound quantiti interest learn includ probabl disagr two halfspac disagr outsid band disagr coeffici use result signific general prior result margin base activ learn disagr base activ learn passiv learn intersect halfspac analysi geometr properti concav distribut might independ interest optim broad|['Maria-Florina Balcan', 'Hongyang Zhang']|['stat.ML', 'cs.AI', 'cs.LG']

Recently, two competing approaches for automatic program learning have received significant attention: (1) neural program synthesis, where a neural network is conditioned on input/output (I/O) examples and learns to generate a program, and (2) neural program induction, where a neural network generates new outputs directly using a latent program representation.   Here, for the first time, we directly compare both approaches on a large-scale, real-world learning task. We additionally contrast to rule-based program synthesis, which uses hand-crafted semantics to guide the program generation. Our neural models use a modified attention RNN to allow encoding of variable-sized sets of I/O pairs. Our best synthesis model achieves 92% accuracy on a real-world test set, compared to the 34% accuracy of the previous best neural synthesis approach. The synthesis model also outperforms a comparable induction model on this task, but we more importantly demonstrate that the strength of each approach is highly dependent on the evaluation metric and end-user application. Finally, we show that we can train our neural models to remain very robust to the type of noise expected in real-world data (e.g., typos), while a highly-engineered rule-based system fails entirely.|problem automat generat comput program specif studi sinc earli day ai recent two compet approach automat program learn receiv signific attent neural program synthesi neural network condit input output exampl learn generat program neural program induct neural network generat new output direct use latent program represent first time direct compar approach larg scale real world learn task addit contrast rule base program synthesi use hand craft semant guid program generat neural model use modifi attent rnn allow encod variabl size set pair best synthesi model achiev accuraci real world test set compar accuraci previous best neural synthesi approach synthesi model also outperform compar induct model task import demonstr strength approach high depend evalu metric end user applic final show train neural model remain veri robust type nois expect real world data typo high engin rule base system fail entir|['Jacob Devlin', 'Jonathan Uesato', 'Surya Bhupatiraju', 'Rishabh Singh', 'Abdel-rahman Mohamed', 'Pushmeet Kohli']|['cs.AI']

Decades of research with stochastic search techniques has shown the benefit of explicitly modeling the interactions between sets of parameters and the overall quality of the solutions discovered. We demonstrate a novel method, based on learning deep networks, to model the global landscapes of optimization problems. To represent the search space concisely and accurately, the deep networks must encode information about the underlying parameter interactions and their contributions to the quality of the solution. Once the networks are trained, the networks are probed to reveal parameter combinations with high expected performance with respect to the optimization task. These estimates are used to initialize fast, randomized, local search algorithms, which in turn expose more information about the search space that is subsequently used to refine the models. We demonstrate the technique on multiple optimization problems that have arisen in a variety of real-world domains, including: packing, graphics, job scheduling, layout and compression.

This usually requires either careful feature engineering, or a significant number of samples. This is far from what we desire: ideally, robots should be able to learn from very few demonstrations of any given task, and instantly generalize to new situations of the same task, without requiring task-specific engineering. In this paper, we propose a meta-learning framework for achieving such capability, which we call one-shot imitation learning.   Specifically, we consider the setting where there is a very large set of tasks, and each task has many instantiations. For example, a task could be to stack all blocks on a table into a single tower, another task could be to place all blocks on a table into two-block towers, etc. In each case, different instances of the task would consist of different sets of blocks with different initial states. At training time, our algorithm is presented with pairs of demonstrations for a subset of all tasks. A neural net is trained that takes as input one demonstration and the current state (which initially is the initial state of the other demonstration of the pair), and outputs an action with the goal that the resulting sequence of states and actions matches as closely as possible with the second demonstration. At test time, a demonstration of a single instance of a new task is presented, and the neural net is expected to perform well on new instances of this new task. The use of soft attention allows the model to generalize to conditions and tasks unseen in the training data. We anticipate that by training this model on a much greater variety of tasks and settings, we will obtain a general system that can turn any demonstrations into robust policies that can accomplish an overwhelming variety of tasks.

A holy-grail solution towards generic image manipulation should be able to efficiently alter an input image with any personalized signals (even signals unseen during training), such as diverse paintings and arbitrary descriptive attributes. However, existing methods are either inefficient to simultaneously process multiple signals (let alone generalize to unseen signals), or unable to handle signals from other modalities. In this paper, we make the first attempt to address the zero-shot image manipulation task. We cast this problem as manipulating an input image according to a parametric model whose key parameters can be conditionally generated from any guiding signal (even unseen ones). To this end, we propose the Zero-shot Manipulation Net (ZM-Net), a fully-differentiable architecture that jointly optimizes an image-transformation network (TNet) and a parameter network (PNet). The PNet learns to generate key transformation parameters for the TNet given any guiding signal while the TNet performs fast zero-shot image manipulation according to both signal-dependent parameters from the PNet and signal-invariant parameters from the TNet itself. Extensive experiments show that our ZM-Net can perform high-quality image manipulation conditioned on different forms of guiding signals (e.g. style images and attributes) in real-time (tens of milliseconds per image) even for unseen signals.

Existing image description methods are largely restricted by small sets of biased visual paragraph annotations, and fail to cover rich underlying semantics. In this paper, we investigate a semi-supervised paragraph generative framework that is able to synthesize diverse and semantically coherent paragraph descriptions by reasoning over local semantic regions and exploiting linguistic knowledge. The proposed Recurrent Topic-Transition Generative Adversarial Network (RTT-GAN) builds an adversarial framework between a structured paragraph generator and multi-level paragraph discriminators. The paragraph generator generates sentences recurrently by incorporating region-based visual and language attention mechanisms at each step. The quality of generated paragraph sentences is assessed by multi-level adversarial discriminators from two aspects, namely, plausibility at sentence level and topic-transition coherence at paragraph level. The joint adversarial training of RTT-GAN drives the model to generate realistic paragraphs with smooth logical transition between sentence topics. Extensive quantitative experiments on image and video paragraph datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our RTT-GAN in both supervised and semi-supervised settings. Qualitative results on telling diverse stories for an image also verify the interpretability of RTT-GAN.|natur imag usual convey rich semant content view differ angl exist imag descript method larg restrict small set bias visual paragraph annot fail cover rich semant paper investig semi supervis paragraph generat framework abl synthes divers semant coher paragraph descript reason local semant region exploit linguist knowledg propos recurr topic transit generat adversari network rtt gan build adversari framework structur paragraph generat multi level paragraph discrimin paragraph generat generat sentenc recurr incorpor region base visual languag attent mechan step qualiti generat paragraph sentenc assess multi level adversari discrimin two aspect name plausibl sentenc level topic transit coher paragraph level joint adversari train rtt gan drive model generat realist paragraph smooth logic transit sentenc topic extens quantit experi imag video paragraph dataset demonstr effect rtt gan supervis semi supervis set qualit result tell divers stori imag also verifi interpret rtt gan|['Xiaodan Liang', 'Zhiting Hu', 'Hao Zhang', 'Chuang Gan', 'Eric P.

Even though several approaches have been proposed to quantify and preserve privacy in such problems, none of them is exempt from limitations. Here we approach the problem by assuming that computation is performed among utilitarian agents. We introduce a utilitarian approach where the utility of each state is estimated as the difference between the reward for reaching an agreement on assignments of shared variables and the cost of privacy loss. We investigate extensions to solvers where agents integrate the utility function to guide their search and decide which action to perform, defining thereby their policy. We show that these extended solvers succeed in significantly reducing privacy loss without significant degradation of the solution quality.|privaci tradit major motiv distribut problem solv distribut constraint satisfact problem discsp well distribut constraint optim problem dcop fundament model use solv various famili distribut problem even though sever approach propos quantifi preserv privaci problem none exempt limit approach problem assum comput perform among utilitarian agent introduc utilitarian approach util state estim differ reward reach agreement assign share variabl cost privaci loss investig extens solver agent integr util function guid search decid action perform defin therebi polici show extend solver succeed signific reduc privaci loss without signific degrad solut qualiti|['Julien Savaux', 'Julien Vion', 'Sylvain Piechowiak', 'Ren√© Mandiau', 'Toshihiro Matsui', 'Katsutoshi Hirayama', 'Makoto Yokoo', 'Shakre Elmane', 'Marius Silaghi']|['cs.AI']

We first introduce a boosting-based approach to learn a correspondence structure which indicates the patch-wise matching probabilities between images from a target camera pair. The learned correspondence structure can not only capture the spatial correspondence pattern between cameras but also handle the viewpoint or human-pose variation in individual images. We further introduce a global constraint-based matching process. It integrates a global matching constraint over the learned correspondence structure to exclude cross-view misalignments during the image patch matching process, hence achieving a more reliable matching score between images. Finally, we also extend our approach by introducing a multi-structure scheme, which learns a set of local correspondence structures to capture the spatial correspondence sub-patterns between a camera pair, so as to handle the spatial misalignments between individual images in a more precise way.

To that end, we are guided by how physicists constructed quantum theory for microscopic entities, which unlike classical objects cannot be fully represented in our spatial theater. We suggest that a similar construction needs to be carried out by linguists and computational scientists, to capture the full meaning content of collections of documental entities. More precisely, we show how to associate a quantum-like 'entity of meaning' to a 'language entity formed by printed documents', considering the latter as the collection of traces that are left by the former, in specific results of search actions that we describe as measurements. In other words, we offer a perspective where a collection of documents, like the Web, is described as the space of manifestation of a more complex entity - the QWeb - which is the object of our modeling, drawing its inspiration from previous studies on operational-realistic approaches to quantum physics and quantum modeling of human cognition and decision-making. We emphasize that a consistent QWeb model needs to account for the observed correlations between words appearing in printed documents, e.g., co-occurrences, as the latter would depend on the 'meaning connections' existing between the concepts that are associated with these words. In that respect, we show that both 'context and interference (quantum) effects' are required to explain the probabilities calculated by counting the relative number of documents containing certain words and co-ocurrrences of words.|elabor quantum model corpora written document like page form world wide web end guid physicist construct quantum theori microscop entiti unlik classic object cannot fulli repres spatial theater suggest similar construct need carri linguist comput scientist captur full mean content collect document entiti precis show associ quantum like entiti mean languag entiti form print document consid latter collect trace left former specif result search action describ measur word offer perspect collect document like web describ space manifest complex entiti qweb object model draw inspir previous studi oper realist approach quantum physic quantum model human cognit decis make emphas consist qweb model need account observ correl word appear print document co occurr latter would depend mean connect exist concept associ word respect show context interfer quantum effect requir explain probabl calcul count relat number document contain certain word co ocurrr word|['Diederik Aerts', 'Jonito Aerts Arguelles', 'Lester Beltran', 'Lyneth Beltran', 'Isaac Distrito', 'Massimiliano Sassoli de Bianchi', 'Sandro Sozzo', 'Tomas Veloz']|['cs.AI', 'cs.CL', 'quant-ph']

Specifically, we pose a cooperative 'image guessing' game between two agents -- Qbot and Abot -- who communicate in natural language dialog so that Qbot can select an unseen image from a lineup of images. We use deep reinforcement learning (RL) to learn the policies of these agents end-to-end -- from pixels to multi-agent multi-round dialog to game reward.   We demonstrate two experimental results.   First, as a 'sanity check' demonstration of pure RL (from scratch), we show results on a synthetic world, where the agents communicate in ungrounded vocabulary, i.e., symbols with no pre-specified meanings (X, Y, Z). We find that two bots invent their own communication protocol and start using certain symbols to ask/answer about certain visual attributes (shape/color/style). Thus, we demonstrate the emergence of grounded language and communication among 'visual' dialog agents with no human supervision.   Second, we conduct large-scale real-image experiments on the VisDial dataset, where we pretrain with supervised dialog data and show that the RL 'fine-tuned' agents significantly outperform SL agents. Interestingly, the RL Qbot learns to ask questions that Abot is good at, ultimately resulting in more informative dialog and a better team.|introduc first goal driven train visual question answer dialog agent specif pose cooper imag guess game two agent qbot abot communic natur languag dialog qbot select unseen imag lineup imag use deep reinforc learn rl learn polici agent end end pixel multi agent multi round dialog game reward demonstr two experiment result first saniti check demonstr pure rl scratch show result synthet world agent communic unground vocabulari symbol pre specifi mean find two bot invent communic protocol start use certain symbol ask answer certain visual attribut shape color style thus demonstr emerg ground languag communic among visual dialog agent human supervis second conduct larg scale real imag experi visdial dataset pretrain supervis dialog data show rl fine tune agent signific outperform sl agent interest rl qbot learn ask question abot good ultim result inform dialog better team|['Abhishek Das', 'Satwik Kottur', 'Jos√© M.

However, big-data environments, where soft (i.e., human or human-based) sources are commonly utilized in addition to hard (i.e., physics-based sensors, pose several challenges to traditional conditioning tasks primarily due to the numerous data/source imperfections that are characteristic of such data. The objective of this paper is to investigate the most natural extension of Bayes conditioning based evidence updates in the presence of such large-scale data uncertainties and source/sensor imperfections. By viewing the evidence updating process as a thought experiment, we devise an elegant strategy for robust evidence updating in the presence of extreme uncertainties characteristic of big-data environments. In particular, we look at the formulation of a belief theoretic evidence updating mechanism that is derived as a natural extension of Bayes conditional approach when the incoming evidence takes the form of a general belief function. Proposed method generalizes the belief theoretic Fagin-Halpern conditional notion, and provides a novel evidence updating strategy that is derived as a natural extension of Bayes conditional applied in a highly uncertain and complex fusion scenario that is characteristic of big-data environments. The presented extension differs fundamentally from the previously published work on Conditional Update Equation (CUE) as well as authors own work.

Recently, semantic segmentation of RGB imagery has advanced significantly due to deep learning. Because creating datasets for semantic segmentation is laborious, these datasets tend to be significantly smaller than object recognition datasets. This makes it difficult to directly train a deep neural network for semantic segmentation, because it will be prone to overfitting. To cope with this, deep learning models typically use convolutional neural networks pre-trained on large-scale image classification datasets, which are then fine-tuned for semantic segmentation. For non-RGB imagery, this is currently not possible because large-scale labeled non-RGB datasets do not exist. In this paper, we developed two deep neural networks for semantic segmentation of multispectral remote sensing imagery. Prior to training on the target dataset, we initialize the networks with large amounts of synthetic multispectral imagery. We show that this significantly improves results on real-world remote sensing imagery, and we establish a new state-of-the-art result on the challenging Hamlin Beach State Park Dataset.|semant segment algorithm must assign label everi pixel imag recent semant segment rgb imageri advanc signific due deep learn becaus creat dataset semant segment labori dataset tend signific smaller object recognit dataset make difficult direct train deep neural network semant segment becaus prone overfit cope deep learn model typic use convolut neural network pre train larg scale imag classif dataset fine tune semant segment non rgb imageri current possibl becaus larg scale label non rgb dataset exist paper develop two deep neural network semant segment multispectr remot sens imageri prior train target dataset initi network larg amount synthet multispectr imageri show signific improv result real world remot sens imageri establish new state art result challeng hamlin beach state park dataset|['Ronald Kemker', 'Christopher Kanan']|['cs.CV', 'cs.AI']

Pedestrian detection is a highly researched topic with mature methods, but most datasets focus on common scenes of people engaged in typical walking poses on sidewalks. But performance is most crucial for dangerous scenarios, such as children playing in the street or people using bicycles/skateboards in unexpected ways. Such ""in-the-tail"" data is notoriously hard to observe, making both training and testing difficult. To analyze this problem, we have collected a novel annotated dataset of dangerous scenarios called the Precarious Pedestrian dataset. Even given a dedicated collection effort, it is relatively small by contemporary standards (around 1000 images). To explore large-scale data-driven learning, we explore the use of synthetic data generated by a game engine. A significant challenge is selected the right ""priors"" or parameters for synthesis: we would like realistic data with realistic poses and object configurations. Inspired by Generative Adversarial Networks, we generate a massive amount of synthetic data and train a discriminative classifier to select a realistic subset, which we deem Synthetic Imposters. We demonstrate that this pipeline allows one to generate realistic training data by making use of rendering/animation engines. Interestingly, we also demonstrate that such data can be used to rank algorithms, suggesting that Synthetic Imposters can also be used for ""in-the-tail"" validation at test-time, a notoriously difficult challenge for real-world deployment."|autonom vehicl becom everi day realiti high accuraci pedestrian detect paramount practic import pedestrian detect high research topic matur method dataset focus common scene peopl engag typic walk pose sidewalk perform crucial danger scenario children play street peopl use bicycl skateboard unexpect way tail data notori hard observ make train test difficult analyz problem collect novel annot dataset danger scenario call precari pedestrian dataset even given dedic collect effort relat small contemporari standard around imag explor larg scale data driven learn explor use synthet data generat game engin signific challeng select right prior paramet synthesi would like realist data realist pose object configur inspir generat adversari network generat massiv amount synthet data train discrimin classifi select realist subset deem synthet impost demonstr pipelin allow one generat realist train data make use render anim engin interest also demonstr data use rank algorithm suggest synthet impost also use tail valid test time notori difficult challeng real world deploy|['Shiyu Huang', 'Deva Ramanan']|['cs.CV', 'cs.AI']

One of the hardest parts of this approach is defining a suitable fitness function. In this paper we explore the possibility of using one of a growing set of General Video Game AI agents to perform automatic play-testing. This enables a very general approach to game evaluation based on estimating the skill-depth of a game. Agent-based play-testing is computationally expensive, so we compare two simple but efficient optimisation algorithms: the Random Mutation Hill-Climber and the Multi-Armed Bandit Random Mutation Hill-Climber. For the test game we use a space-battle game in order to provide a suitable balance between simulation speed and potential skill-depth. Results show that both algorithms are able to rapidly evolve game versions with significant skill-depth, but that choosing a suitable resampling number is essential in order to combat the effects of noise.|game generalis number paramet may vari order provid instanc game lead veri differ player experi space possibl paramet set seen search space therefor use random mutat hill climb algorithm search method find paramet set induc best game one hardest part approach defin suitabl fit function paper explor possibl use one grow set general video game ai agent perform automat play test enabl veri general approach game evalu base estim skill depth game agent base play test comput expens compar two simpl effici optimis algorithm random mutat hill climber multi arm bandit random mutat hill climber test game use space battl game order provid suitabl balanc simul speed potenti skill depth result show algorithm abl rapid evolv game version signific skill depth choos suitabl resampl number essenti order combat effect nois|['Jialin Liu', 'Julian Togelius', 'Diego Perez-Liebana', 'Simon M.

Historical milestones have been frequently associated with computers matching or outperforming humans in difficult cognitive tasks (e.g. face recognition [2], personality classification [3], driving cars [4], or playing video games [5]), or defeating humans in strategic zero-sum encounters (e.g. Chess [6], Checkers [7], Jeopardy! [8], Poker [9], or Go [10]). In contrast, less attention has been given to developing autonomous machines that establish mutually cooperative relationships with people who may not share the machine's preferences. A main challenge has been that human cooperation does not require sheer computational power, but rather relies on intuition [11], cultural norms [12], emotions and signals [13, 14, 15, 16], and pre-evolved dispositions toward cooperation [17], common-sense mechanisms that are difficult to encode in machines for arbitrary contexts. Here, we combine a state-of-the-art machine-learning algorithm with novel mechanisms for generating and acting on signals to produce a new learning algorithm that cooperates with people and other machines at levels that rival human cooperation in a variety of two-player repeated stochastic games. This is the first general-purpose algorithm that is capable, given a description of a previously unseen game environment, of learning to cooperate with people within short timescales in scenarios previously unanticipated by algorithm designers. This is achieved without complex opponent modeling or higher-order theories of mind, thus showing that flexible, fast, and general human-machine cooperation is computationally achievable using a non-trivial, but ultimately simple, set of algorithmic mechanisms.|sinc alan ture envis artifici intellig ai major drive forc behind technic progress competit human cognit histor mileston frequent associ comput match outperform human difficult cognit task face recognit person classif drive car play video game defeat human strateg zero sum encount chess checker jeopardi poker go contrast less attent given develop autonom machin establish mutual cooper relationship peopl may share machin prefer main challeng human cooper doe requir sheer comput power rather reli intuit cultur norm emot signal pre evolv disposit toward cooper common sens mechan difficult encod machin arbitrari context combin state art machin learn algorithm novel mechan generat act signal produc new learn algorithm cooper peopl machin level rival human cooper varieti two player repeat stochast game first general purpos algorithm capabl given descript previous unseen game environ learn cooper peopl within short timescal scenario previous unanticip algorithm design achiev without complex oppon model higher order theori mind thus show flexibl fast general human machin cooper comput achiev use non trivial ultim simpl set algorithm mechan|['Jacob W.

Learning is challenging in these settings due to local viewpoints of agents, which perceive the world as non-stationary due to concurrently-exploring teammates. Approaches that learn specialized policies for individual tasks face major problems when applied to the real world: not only do agents have to learn and store a distinct policy for each task, but in practice the identity of the task is often non-observable, making these algorithms inapplicable. This paper formalizes and addresses the problem of multi-task multi-agent reinforcement learning under partial observability. We introduce a decentralized single-task learning approach that is robust to concurrent interactions of teammates, and present an approach for distilling single-task policies into a unified policy that performs well across multiple related tasks, without explicit provision of task identity.|mani real world task involv multipl agent partial observ limit communic learn challeng set due local viewpoint agent perceiv world non stationari due concurr explor teammat approach learn special polici individu task face major problem appli real world onli agent learn store distinct polici task practic ident task often non observ make algorithm inapplic paper formal address problem multi task multi agent reinforc learn partial observ introduc decentr singl task learn approach robust concurr interact teammat present approach distil singl task polici unifi polici perform well across multipl relat task without explicit provis task ident|['Shayegan Omidshafiei', 'Jason Pazis', 'Christopher Amato', 'Jonathan P.

We show that this is a tight bound, as we can find an approximation within a linear factor in three-level networks. We then show that in four-level trees it is NP-hard to approximate the problem within a factor $2^{f(n)}$ for any sublinear function $f$ of the size of the input $n$. Again, this is bound is tight, as we prove that the usual max-product algorithm finds (in any network) approximations within factor $2^{c n}$ from some constant $c < 1$.

For the first time, to the best of our knowledge, we change this paradigm in an approximate query processing (AQP) context. We make the following observation: the answer to each query reveals some degree of knowledge about the answer to another query because their answers stem from the same underlying distribution that has produced the entire dataset. Exploiting and refining this knowledge should allow us to answer queries more analytically, rather than by reading enormous amounts of raw data. Also, processing more queries should continuously enhance our knowledge of the underlying distribution, and hence lead to increasingly faster response times for future queries.   We call this novel idea---learning from past query answers---Database Learning. We exploit the principle of maximum entropy to produce answers, which are in expectation guaranteed to be more accurate than existing sample-based approximations. Empowered by this idea, we build a query engine on top of Spark SQL, called Verdict. We conduct extensive experiments on real-world query traces from a large customer of a major database vendor. Our results demonstrate that database learning supports 73.7% of these queries, speeding them up by up to 23.0x for the same accuracy level compared to existing AQP systems.|today databas previous queri answer rare benefit answer futur queri first time best knowledg chang paradigm approxim queri process aqp context make follow observ answer queri reveal degre knowledg answer anoth queri becaus answer stem distribut produc entir dataset exploit refin knowledg allow us answer queri analyt rather read enorm amount raw data also process queri continu enhanc knowledg distribut henc lead increas faster respons time futur queri call novel idea learn past queri answer databas learn exploit principl maximum entropi produc answer expect guarante accur exist sampl base approxim empow idea build queri engin top spark sql call verdict conduct extens experi real world queri trace larg custom major databas vendor result demonstr databas learn support queri speed accuraci level compar exist aqp system|['Yongjoo Park', 'Ahmad Shahab Tajik', 'Michael Cafarella', 'Barzan Mozafari']|['cs.DB', 'cs.AI']

Existing algorithms are either heuristics with no guarantees, or scale poorly (with exponential run time in terms of the number of available tests). Moreover, these methods assume a known distribution over the test outcomes, which is often not the case in practice. We propose an efficient sampling-based online learning framework to address the above issues. First, assuming the distribution over hypotheses is known, we propose a dynamic hypothesis enumeration strategy, which allows efficient information gathering with strong theoretical guarantees. We show that with sufficient amount of samples, one can identify a near-optimal decision with high probability. Second, when the parameters of the hypotheses distribution are unknown, we propose an algorithm which learns the parameters progressively via posterior sampling in an online fashion. We further establish a rigorous bound on the expected regret.

Given these rich annotations we perform detailed analyses of the leading human parsing approaches, gaining insights into the success and failures of these methods. Furthermore, in contrast to the existing efforts on improving the feature discriminative capability, we solve human parsing by exploring a novel self-supervised structure-sensitive learning approach, which imposes human pose structures into parsing results without resorting to extra supervision (i.e., no need for specifically labeling human joints in model training). Our self-supervised learning framework can be injected into any advanced neural networks to help incorporate rich high-level knowledge regarding human joints from a global perspective and improve the parsing results.

However, due to lack of knowledge, information of time pressure, decision makers might not be able to provide a (crisp) ranking of objects from the top to the bottom. Instead, some objects might be ranked equally, or better than other objects only to some degree. In such cases, a generalization of crisp rankings to fuzzy rankings can be more useful. The aim of the article is to introduce the notion of a fuzzy ranking and to discuss its several properties, namely orderings, similarity and indecisiveness.

In this study here, we present two new sets of belief change operators for logic programs. They focus on preserving the explicit relationships expressed in the rules of a program, a feature that is missing in purely semantic approaches that consider programs only in their entirety. In particular, operators of the latter class fail to satisfy preservation and support, two important properties for belief change in logic programs required to ensure intuitive results.   We address this shortcoming of existing approaches by introducing partial meet and ensconcement constructions for logic program belief change, which allow us to define syntax-preserving operators that satisfy preservation and support. Our work is novel in that our constructions not only preserve more information from a logic program during a change operation than existing ones, but they also facilitate natural definitions of contraction operators, the first in the field to the best of our knowledge.   In order to evaluate the rationality of our operators, we translate the revision and contraction postulates from the AGM and belief base frameworks to the logic programming setting. We show that our operators fully comply with the belief base framework and formally state the interdefinability between our operators. We further propose an algorithm that is based on modularising a logic program to reduce partial meet and ensconcement revisions or contractions to performing the operation only on the relevant modules of that program. Finally, we compare our approach to two state-of-the-art logic program revision methods and demonstrate that our operators address the shortcomings of one and generalise the other method.|recent method adapt well establish agm belief base framework belief chang cover belief revis logic program studi present two new set belief chang oper logic program focus preserv explicit relationship express rule program featur miss pure semant approach consid program onli entireti particular oper latter class fail satisfi preserv support two import properti belief chang logic program requir ensur intuit result address shortcom exist approach introduc partial meet ensconc construct logic program belief chang allow us defin syntax preserv oper satisfi preserv support work novel construct onli preserv inform logic program dure chang oper exist one also facilit natur definit contract oper first field best knowledg order evalu ration oper translat revis contract postul agm belief base framework logic program set show oper fulli compli belief base framework formal state interdefin oper propos algorithm base modularis logic program reduc partial meet ensconc revis contract perform oper onli relev modul program final compar approach two state art logic program revis method demonstr oper address shortcom one generalis method|['Sebastian Binnewies', 'Zhiqiang Zhuang', 'Kewen Wang', 'Bela Stantic']|['cs.AI', 'I.2.3; I.2.4; F.4.1']

Towards this end, we propose a multi-agent learning environment and learning methods that bring about emergence of a basic compositional language.

We further demonstrate, that an extended version (FastQAExt) achieves state-of-the-art results on recent benchmark datasets, namely SQuAD, NewsQA and MsMARCO, outperforming most existing models. However, we show that increasing the complexity of FastQA to FastQAExt does not yield any systematic improvements. We argue that the same holds true for most existing systems that are similar to FastQAExt. A manual analysis reveals that our proposed heuristic explains most predictions of our model, which indicates that modeling a simple heuristic is enough to achieve strong performance on extractive QA datasets.

Specifically, given a voting rule, we wish to design a weighting scheme such that applying the voting rule, with voters weighted by the scheme, leads to choices that are almost as good as those endorsed by the best voter in hindsight. We derive possibility and impossibility results for the existence of such weighting schemes, depending on whether the voting rule and the weighting scheme are deterministic or randomized, as well as on the social choice axioms satisfied by the voting rule.|vote system typic treat voter equal argu perhap voter support good choic past given higher weight voter support bad one develop formal framework desir weight scheme draw regret learn specif given vote rule wish design weight scheme appli vote rule voter weight scheme lead choic almost good endors best voter hindsight deriv possibl imposs result exist weight scheme depend whether vote rule weight scheme determinist random well social choic axiom satisfi vote rule|['Nika Haghtalab', 'Ritesh Noothigattu', 'Ariel D.

Then we examine problematic areas regarding the specification and verification of ethical behavior in autonomous systems, particularly with a view towards the requirements of future legislation. We discuss transparency and accountability issues that will be crucial for any future wide deployment of autonomous systems in society.

Applying ideas from second-order optimization, we scale up influence functions to modern machine learning settings and show that they can be applied to high-dimensional black-box models, even in non-convex and non-differentiable settings. We give a simple, efficient implementation that requires only oracle access to gradients and Hessian-vector products.

The ACT-R based Lewis & Vasishth 2005 model is used to implement these three proposals. Slowed processing is implemented as slowed default production-rule firing time; intermittent deficiency as increased random noise in activation of chunks in memory; and resource reduction as reduced goal activation. As data, we considered subject vs. object relatives presented in a self-paced listening modality to 56 individuals with aphasia (IWA) and 46 matched controls. The participants heard the sentences and carried out a picture verification task to decide on an interpretation of the sentence. These response accuracies are used to identify the best parameters (for each participant) that correspond to the three hypotheses mentioned above. We show that controls have more tightly clustered (less variable) parameter values than IWA; specifically, compared to controls, among IWA there are more individuals with low goal activations, high noise, and slow default action times. This suggests that (i) individual patients show differential amounts of deficit along the three dimensions of slowed processing, intermittent deficient, and resource reduction, (ii) overall, there is evidence for all three sources of deficit playing a role, and (iii) IWA have a more variable range of parameter values than controls. In sum, this study contributes a proof of concept of a quantitative implementation of, and evidence for, these three accounts of comprehension deficits in aphasia.|present comput evalu three hypothes sourc deficit sentenc comprehens aphasia slow process intermitt defici resourc reduct act base lewi vasishth model use implement three propos slow process implement slow default product rule fire time intermitt defici increas random nois activ chunk memori resourc reduct reduc goal activ data consid subject vs object relat present self pace listen modal individu aphasia iwa match control particip heard sentenc carri pictur verif task decid interpret sentenc respons accuraci use identifi best paramet particip correspond three hypothes mention abov show control tight cluster less variabl paramet valu iwa specif compar control among iwa individu low goal activ high nois slow default action time suggest individu patient show differenti amount deficit along three dimens slow process intermitt defici resourc reduct ii overal evid three sourc deficit play role iii iwa variabl rang paramet valu control sum studi contribut proof concept quantit implement evid three account comprehens deficit aphasia|['Paul M√§tzig', 'Shravan Vasishth', 'Felix Engelmann', 'David Caplan']|['cs.CL', 'cs.AI']

Crucially, an agent receives observations (of reward and state transitions) that allow it to potentially eliminate possible environments and thus obtain higher utility by adapting its policy to the history of observations.

This model gives conceptual insight into the fundamentally systematic nature of symbol grounding, and also connects naturally to practical real-world AI systems in current research and commercial use. Specifically, it is argued that the structure of linguistic syntax can be modeled as a certain asymmetric monoidal category, as e.g. implicit in the link grammar formalism; the structure of spatiotemporal relationships and action plans can be modeled similarly using ""image grammars"" and ""action grammars""; and common-sense logical semantic structure can be modeled using dependently-typed lambda calculus with uncertain truth values.

For example, when applied to image segmentation, the value network takes an image and a segmentation mask as inputs and predicts a scalar score evaluating the mask quality and its correspondence with the image. Once the value network is optimized, at inference, it finds output structures that maximize the score of the value net via gradient descent on continuous relaxations of structured outputs. Thus DVN takes advantage of the joint modeling of the inputs and outputs. Our framework applies to a wide range of structured output prediction problems. We conduct experiments on multi-label classification based on text data and on image segmentation problems. DVN outperforms several strong baselines and the state-of-the-art results on these benchmarks. In addition, on image segmentation, the proposed deep value network learns complex shape priors and effectively combines image information with the prior to obtain competitive segmentation results.|approach structur output predict learn deep valu network dvn evalu differ output structur given input exampl appli imag segment valu network take imag segment mask input predict scalar score evalu mask qualiti correspond imag onc valu network optim infer find output structur maxim score valu net via gradient descent continu relax structur output thus dvn take advantag joint model input output framework appli wide rang structur output predict problem conduct experi multi label classif base text data imag segment problem dvn outperform sever strong baselin state art result benchmark addit imag segment propos deep valu network learn complex shape prior effect combin imag inform prior obtain competit segment result|['Michael Gygli', 'Mohammad Norouzi', 'Anelia Angelova']|['cs.LG', 'cs.AI', 'cs.CV']

Cognitive synergy has been posited as a key feature of real-world general intelligence, and has been used explicitly in the design of the OpenCog cognitive architecture. Here category theory and related concepts are used to give a formalization of the cognitive synergy concept.   A series of formal models of intelligent agents is proposed, with increasing specificity and complexity: simple reinforcement learning agents; ""cognit"" agents with an abstract memory and processing model; hypergraph-based agents (in which ""cognit"" operations are carried out via hypergraphs); hypergraph agents with a rich language of nodes and hyperlinks (such as the OpenCog framework provides); ""PGMC"" agents whose rich hypergraphs are endowed with cognitive processes guided via Probabilistic Growth and Mining of Combinations; and finally variations of the PrimeAGI design, which is currently being built on top of OpenCog.   A notion of cognitive synergy is developed for cognitive processes acting within PGMC agents, based on developing a formal notion of ""stuckness,"" and defining synergy as a relationship between cognitive processes in which they can help each other out when they get stuck. It is proposed that cognitive processes relating to each other synergetically, associate in a certain way with functors that map into each other via natural transformations. Cognitive synergy is proposed to correspond to a certain inequality regarding the relative costs of different paths through certain commutation diagrams.   Applications of this notion of cognitive synergy to particular cognitive phenomena, and specific cognitive processes in the PrimeAGI design, are discussed."|cognit synergi refer dynam multipl cognit process cooper control cognit system assist overcom bottleneck encount dure intern process cognit synergi posit key featur real world general intellig use explicit design opencog cognit architectur categori theori relat concept use give formal cognit synergi concept seri formal model intellig agent propos increas specif complex simpl reinforc learn agent cognit agent abstract memori process model hypergraph base agent cognit oper carri via hypergraph hypergraph agent rich languag node hyperlink opencog framework provid pgmc agent whose rich hypergraph endow cognit process guid via probabilist growth mine combin final variat primeagi design current built top opencog notion cognit synergi develop cognit process act within pgmc agent base develop formal notion stuck defin synergi relationship cognit process help get stuck propos cognit process relat synerget associ certain way functor map via natur transform cognit synergi propos correspond certain inequ regard relat cost differ path certain commut diagram applic notion cognit synergi particular cognit phenomena specif cognit process primeagi design discuss|['Ben Goertzel']|['cs.AI']

In addition, it is required that each state on the trajectory induced by the execution of plans complies with a given set of global constraints. We approach the computation of plans for such domains as the problem of searching over a deterministic state model. In this model, some of the successor states are obtained by solving numerically the so-called initial value problem over a set of ordinary differential equations (ODE) given by the current plan prefix. These equations hold over time intervals whose duration is determined dynamically, according to whether zero crossing events take place for a set of invariant conditions. The resulting planner, FS+, incorporates these features together with effective heuristic guidance. FS+ does not impose any of the syntactic restrictions on process effects often found on the existing literature on Hybrid Planning. A key concept of our approach is that a clear separation is struck between planning and simulation time steps. The former is the time allowed to observe the evolution of a given dynamical system before committing to a future course of action, whilst the later is part of the model of the environment. FS+ is shown to be a robust planner over a diverse set of hybrid domains, taken from the existing literature on hybrid planning and systems.|paper look problem plan hybrid domain chang discret instantan continu time addit requir state trajectori induc execut plan compli given set global constraint approach comput plan domain problem search determinist state model model successor state obtain solv numer call initi valu problem set ordinari differenti equat ode given current plan prefix equat hold time interv whose durat determin dynam accord whether zero cross event take place set invari condit result planner fs incorpor featur togeth effect heurist guidanc fs doe impos ani syntact restrict process effect often found exist literatur hybrid plan key concept approach clear separ struck plan simul time step former time allow observ evolut given dynam system befor commit futur cours action whilst later part model environ fs shown robust planner divers set hybrid domain taken exist literatur hybrid plan system|['Miquel Ramirez', 'Enrico Scala', 'Patrik Haslum', 'Sylvie Thiebaux']|['cs.AI', 'I.2.8; F.2.2; I.6; J.2']

However, a complete cloud resource allocation framework exhibits high dimensions in state and action spaces, which prohibit the usefulness of traditional RL techniques. In addition, high power consumption has become one of the critical concerns in design and control of cloud computing systems, which degrades system reliability and increases cooling cost. An effective dynamic power management (DPM) policy should minimize power consumption while maintaining performance degradation within an acceptable level. Thus, a joint virtual machine (VM) resource allocation and power management framework is critical to the overall cloud computing system. Moreover, novel solution framework is necessary to address the even higher dimensions in state and action spaces. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical framework for solving the overall resource allocation and power management problem in cloud computing systems. The proposed hierarchical framework comprises a global tier for VM resource allocation to the servers and a local tier for distributed power management of local servers. The emerging deep reinforcement learning (DRL) technique, which can deal with complicated control problems with large state space, is adopted to solve the global tier problem. Furthermore, an autoencoder and a novel weight sharing structure are adopted to handle the high-dimensional state space and accelerate the convergence speed. On the other hand, the local tier of distributed server power managements comprises an LSTM based workload predictor and a model-free RL based power manager, operating in a distributed manner.|automat decis make approach reinforc learn rl appli partial solv resourc alloc problem adapt cloud comput system howev complet cloud resourc alloc framework exhibit high dimens state action space prohibit use tradit rl techniqu addit high power consumpt becom one critic concern design control cloud comput system degrad system reliabl increas cool cost effect dynam power manag dpm polici minim power consumpt maintain perform degrad within accept level thus joint virtual machin vm resourc alloc power manag framework critic overal cloud comput system moreov novel solut framework necessari address even higher dimens state action space paper propos novel hierarch framework solv overal resourc alloc power manag problem cloud comput system propos hierarch framework compris global tier vm resourc alloc server local tier distribut power manag local server emerg deep reinforc learn drl techniqu deal complic control problem larg state space adopt solv global tier problem furthermor autoencod novel weight share structur adopt handl high dimension state space acceler converg speed hand local tier distribut server power manag compris lstm base workload predictor model free rl base power manag oper distribut manner|['Ning Liu', 'Zhe Li', 'Zhiyuan Xu', 'Jielong Xu', 'Sheng Lin', 'Qinru Qiu', 'Jian Tang', 'Yanzhi Wang']|['cs.DC', 'cs.AI']

A novel any-angle planner based on Safe Interval Path Planning (SIPP) algorithm is proposed to find trajectories for an agent moving amidst dynamic obstacles (other agents) on a grid.

No accuracy drop on image classification is observed on these extremely compact networks, compared to well-known models. An emerging question, however, is whether these model compression techniques hurt DNN's learning ability other than classifying images on a single dataset. Our preliminary experiment shows that these compression methods could degrade domain adaptation (DA) ability, though the classification performance is preserved. Therefore, we propose a new compact network architecture and unsupervised DA method in this paper. The DNN is built on a new basic module Conv-M which provides more diverse feature extractors without significantly increasing parameters. The unified framework of our DA method will simultaneously learn invariance across domains, reduce divergence of feature representations, and adapt label prediction. Our DNN has 4.1M parameters, which is only 6.7% of AlexNet or 59% of GoogLeNet. Experiments show that our DNN obtains GoogLeNet-level accuracy both on classification and DA, and our DA method slightly outperforms previous competitive ones. Put all together, our DA strategy based on our DNN achieves state-of-the-art on sixteen of total eighteen DA tasks on popular Office-31 and Office-Caltech datasets.|recent dnn model compress base network architectur design squeezenet attract lot attent accuraci drop imag classif observ extrem compact network compar well known model emerg question howev whether model compress techniqu hurt dnn learn abil classifi imag singl dataset preliminari experi show compress method could degrad domain adapt da abil though classif perform preserv therefor propos new compact network architectur unsupervis da method paper dnn built new basic modul conv provid divers featur extractor without signific increas paramet unifi framework da method simultan learn invari across domain reduc diverg featur represent adapt label predict dnn paramet onli alexnet googlenet experi show dnn obtain googlenet level accuraci classif da da method slight outperform previous competit one put togeth da strategi base dnn achiev state art sixteen total eighteen da task popular offic offic caltech dataset|['Chunpeng Wu', 'Wei Wen', 'Tariq Afzal', 'Yongmei Zhang', 'Yiran Chen', 'Hai Li']|['cs.CV', 'cs.AI', 'cs.NE']

At the core of the AHP are various prioritization procedures (PPs) and consistency measures (CMs) for a Pairwise Comparison Matrix (PCM) which, in a sense, reflects preferences of decision makers. Certainly, when judgments about these preferences are perfectly consistent (cardinally transitive), all PPs coincide and the quality of the priority ratios (PRs) estimation is exemplary. However, human judgments are very rarely consistent, thus the quality of PRs estimation may significantly vary. The scale of these variations depends on the applied PP and utilized CM for a PCM. This is why it is important to find out which PPs and which CMs for a PCM lead directly to an improvement of the PRs estimation accuracy. The main goal of this research is realized through the properly designed, coded and executed seminal and sophisticated simulation algorithms in Wolfram Mathematica 8.0. These research results convince that the embedded in the AHP and commonly applied, both genuine PP and CM for PCM may significantly deteriorate the quality of PRs estimation; however, solutions proposed in this paper can significantly improve the methodology.|overview current debat contemporari research devot model decis make process facilit direct attent analyt hierarchi process ahp core ahp various priorit procedur pps consist measur cms pairwis comparison matrix pcm sens reflect prefer decis maker certain judgment prefer perfect consist cardin transit pps coincid qualiti prioriti ratio prs estim exemplari howev human judgment veri rare consist thus qualiti prs estim may signific vari scale variat depend appli pp util cm pcm whi import find pps cms pcm lead direct improv prs estim accuraci main goal research realiz proper design code execut semin sophist simul algorithm wolfram mathematica research result convinc embed ahp common appli genuin pp cm pcm may signific deterior qualiti prs estim howev solut propos paper signific improv methodolog|['Paul Thaddeus Kazibudzki']|['cs.AI']

For each task, an under-complete autoencoder is learned, capturing the features that are crucial for its achievement. When a new task is presented to the system, we prevent the reconstructions of the features with these autoencoders from changing, which has the effect of preserving the information on which the previous tasks are mainly relying. At the same time, the features are given space to adjust to the most recent environment as only their projection into a low dimension submanifold is controlled.

To address this problem, this work proposes an online hash model to accommodate data coming in stream for online learning. Specifically, a new loss function is proposed to measure the similarity loss between a pair of data samples in hamming space. Then, a structured hash model is derived and optimized in a passive-aggressive way. Theoretical analysis on the upper bound of the cumulative loss for the proposed online hash model is provided. Furthermore, we extend our online hashing from a single-model to a multi-model online hashing that trains multiple models so as to retain diverse online hashing models in order to avoid biased update. The competitive efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed online hash models are verified through extensive experiments on several large-scale datasets as compared to related hashing methods.|although hash function learn algorithm achiev great success recent year exist hash model line suitabl process sequenti onlin data address problem work propos onlin hash model accommod data come stream onlin learn specif new loss function propos measur similar loss pair data sampl ham space structur hash model deriv optim passiv aggress way theoret analysi upper bound cumul loss propos onlin hash model provid furthermor extend onlin hash singl model multi model onlin hash train multipl model retain divers onlin hash model order avoid bias updat competit effici effect propos onlin hash model verifi extens experi sever larg scale dataset compar relat hash method|['Long-Kai Huang', 'Qiang Yang', 'Wei-Shi Zheng']|['cs.CV', 'cs.AI']

It is easy to collect and domain independent. However, there is a lack of negative examples. Existing works circumvent this problem by making various assumptions regarding the unconsumed items, which fail to hold when the user did not consume an item because she was unaware of it. In this paper we propose Conformative Filtering (CoF) as a novel method for addressing the lack of negative examples in implicit feedback. The motivation is that if there is a large group of users who share the same taste and none of them consumed an item, then it is highly likely that the item is irrelevant to this taste. We use Hierarchical Latent Tree Analysis (HLTA) to identify taste-based user groups, and make recommendations for a user based on her memberships in the groups. Experiments on real-world datasets from different domains show that CoF has superior performance compared to other baselines and more than 10% improvement in Recall@5 and Recall@10 is observed.|implicit feedback simplest form user feedback use item recommend easi collect domain independ howev lack negat exampl exist work circumv problem make various assumpt regard unconsum item fail hold user consum item becaus unawar paper propos conform filter cof novel method address lack negat exampl implicit feedback motiv larg group user share tast none consum item high like item irrelev tast use hierarch latent tree analysi hlta identifi tast base user group make recommend user base membership group experi real world dataset differ domain show cof superior perform compar baselin improv recal recal observ|['Farhan Khawar', 'Nevin L.

The intermediate step of preprocessing the graph increases the time and memory requirements of the classical motion planning technique in exchange for speeding up individual queries making the method advantageous in multi-query applications.

The instrumental variable (IV) and local causal discovery (LCD) patterns are canonical examples of settings where a closed-form expression exists for the causal effect of one variable on another, given the presence of a third variable. Both rely on faithfulness to infer that the latter only influences the target effect via the cause variable. In reality, it is likely that this assumption only holds approximately and that there will be at least some form of weak interaction. This brings about the paradoxical situation that, in the large-sample limit, no predictions are made, as detecting the weak edge invalidates the setting. We introduce an alternative approach by replacing strict faithfulness with a prior that reflects the existence of many 'weak' (irrelevant) and 'strong' interactions. We obtain a posterior distribution over the target causal effect estimator which shows that, in many cases, we can still make good estimates. We demonstrate the approach in an application on a simple linear-Gaussian setting, using the MultiNest sampling algorithm, and compare it with established techniques to show our method is robust even when strict faithfulness is violated.|causal effect estim observ data import much studi research topic instrument variabl iv local causal discoveri lcd pattern canon exampl set close form express exist causal effect one variabl anoth given presenc third variabl reli faith infer latter onli influenc target effect via caus variabl realiti like assumpt onli hold approxim least form weak interact bring paradox situat larg sampl limit predict made detect weak edg invalid set introduc altern approach replac strict faith prior reflect exist mani weak irrelev strong interact obtain posterior distribut target causal effect estim show mani case still make good estim demonstr approach applic simpl linear gaussian set use multinest sampl algorithm compar establish techniqu show method robust even strict faith violat|['Ioan Gabriel Bucur', 'Tom Claassen', 'Tom Heskes']|['stat.ML', 'cs.AI', 'stat.ME']

This aspect requires the vehicle routes to be updated in an ongoing manner as new customer requests arrive in the system and must be incorporated into an evolving schedule during the working day. Besides the vehicle capacity constraint involved in the classical VRP, DVRPTW considers in addition time windows, which are able to better capture real-world situations. Despite this, so far, few studies have focused on tackling this problem of greater practical importance. To this end, this study devises for the resolution of DVRPTW, an ant colony optimization based algorithm, which resorts to a joint solution construction mechanism, able to construct in parallel the vehicle routes. This method is coupled with a local search procedure, aimed to further improve the solutions built by ants, and with an insertion heuristics, which tries to reduce the number of vehicles used to service the available customers. The experiments indicate that the proposed algorithm is competitive and effective, and on DVRPTW instances with a higher dynamicity level, it is able to yield better results compared to existing ant-based approaches.|dynam vehicl rout problem time window dvrptw extens well known vehicl rout problem vrp take account dynam natur problem aspect requir vehicl rout updat ongo manner new custom request arriv system must incorpor evolv schedul dure work day besid vehicl capac constraint involv classic vrp dvrptw consid addit time window abl better captur real world situat despit far studi focus tackl problem greater practic import end studi devis resolut dvrptw ant coloni optim base algorithm resort joint solut construct mechan abl construct parallel vehicl rout method coupl local search procedur aim improv solut built ant insert heurist tri reduc number vehicl use servic avail custom experi indic propos algorithm competit effect dvrptw instanc higher dynam level abl yield better result compar exist ant base approach|['Raluca Necula', 'Mihaela Breaban', 'Madalina Raschip']|['cs.NE', 'cs.AI']

We propose an architecture, called Semantic Maps (SeMaps), for assisting the authoring and hosting of applications in which the maps combine the aggregation of a Geographic Information System and crowd-generated content (called here crowd maps). In these systems, the digital map works as a blackboard for accommodating stories told by people about events they want to share with others typically participating in their social networks. SeMaps offers an environment for the creation and maintenance of sites based on crowd maps with the possibility for the user to characterize semantically that which s/he intends to mark on the map. The designer of a crowd map, by informing a linguistic expression that designates what has to be marked on the maps, is guided in a process that aims to associate a concept from a common-sense base to this linguistic expression. Thus, the crowd maps start to have dominion over common-sense inferential relations that define the meaning of the marker, and are able to make inferences about the network of linked data. This makes it possible to generate maps that have the power to perform inferences and access external sources (such as DBpedia) that constitute information that is useful and appropriate to the context of the map. In this paper we describe the architecture of SeMaps and how it was applied in a crowd map authoring tool.|although increas initi generat semant knowledg base user particip still shortag platform regular user creat applic semant data exploit generat automat propos architectur call semant map semap assist author host applic map combin aggreg geograph inform system crowd generat content call crowd map system digit map work blackboard accommod stori told peopl event want share typic particip social network semap offer environ creation mainten site base crowd map possibl user character semant intend mark map design crowd map inform linguist express design mark map guid process aim associ concept common sens base linguist express thus crowd map start dominion common sens inferenti relat defin mean marker abl make infer network link data make possibl generat map power perform infer access extern sourc dbpedia constitut inform use appropri context map paper describ architectur semap appli crowd map author tool|['Henrique Santos', 'Vasco Furtado']|['cs.AI', 'cs.CY', 'I.2.4']

Many of those efforts resulted in one or more high-quality ontologies that describe some aspects of scientific measurements, but not in a comprehensive and coherently integrated manner. For instance, we note that many of these high-quality ontologies are not properly aligned, and more challenging, that they have different and often conflicting concepts and approaches for encoding knowledge about empirical measurements. As a result of this lack of an integrated view, it is often challenging for scientists to determine whether any two scientific measurements were taken in semantically compatible manners, thus making it difficult to decide whether measurements should be analyzed in combination or not. In this paper, we present the Human-Aware Sensor Network Ontology that is a comprehensive alignment and integration of a sensing infrastructure ontology and a provenance ontology.

Under this mandate, many of these governments are publishing data under the umbrella of open government data, which includes measurement data from city-wide sensor networks. Furthermore, many of these data are published in so-called data portals as documents that may be spreadsheets, comma-separated value (CSV) data files, or plain documents in PDF or Word documents. The sharing of these documents may be a convenient way for the data provider to convey and publish data but it is not the ideal way for data consumers to reuse the data. For example, the problems of reusing the data may range from difficulty opening a document that is provided in any format that is not plain text, to the actual problem of understanding the meaning of each piece of knowledge inside of the document. Our proposal tackles those challenges by identifying metadata that has been regarded to be relevant for measurement data and providing a schema for this metadata.

Each of these feature sets provides a unique semantic perspective (or view) of apps' behaviours with inherent strengths and limitations. Meaning, some views are more amenable to detect certain attacks but may not be suitable to characterise several other attacks. Most of the existing malware detection approaches use only one (or a selected few) of the aforementioned feature sets which prevent them from detecting a vast majority of attacks. Addressing this limitation, we propose MKLDroid, a unified framework that systematically integrates multiple views of apps for performing comprehensive malware detection and malicious code localisation. The rationale is that, while a malware app can disguise itself in some views, disguising in every view while maintaining malicious intent will be much harder.   MKLDroid uses a graph kernel to capture structural and contextual information from apps' dependency graphs and identify malice code patterns in each view. Subsequently, it employs Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) to find a weighted combination of the views which yields the best detection accuracy. Besides multi-view learning, MKLDroid's unique and salient trait is its ability to locate fine-grained malice code portions in dependency graphs (e.g., methods/classes). Through our large-scale experiments on several datasets (incl. wild apps), we demonstrate that MKLDroid outperforms three state-of-the-art techniques consistently, in terms of accuracy while maintaining comparable efficiency. In our malicious code localisation experiments on a dataset of repackaged malware, MKLDroid was able to identify all the malice classes with 94% average recall.|exist android malwar detect approach use varieti featur secur sensit api system call control flow structur inform flow conjunct machin learn classifi achiev accur detect featur set provid uniqu semant perspect view app behaviour inher strength limit mean view amen detect certain attack may suitabl characteris sever attack exist malwar detect approach use onli one select aforement featur set prevent detect vast major attack address limit propos mkldroid unifi framework systemat integr multipl view app perform comprehens malwar detect malici code localis rational malwar app disguis view disguis everi view maintain malici intent much harder mkldroid use graph kernel captur structur contextu inform app depend graph identifi malic code pattern view subsequ employ multipl kernel learn mkl find weight combin view yield best detect accuraci besid multi view learn mkldroid uniqu salient trait abil locat fine grain malic code portion depend graph method class larg scale experi sever dataset incl wild app demonstr mkldroid outperform three state art techniqu consist term accuraci maintain compar effici malici code localis experi dataset repackag malwar mkldroid abl identifi malic class averag recal|['Annamalai Narayanan', 'Mahinthan Chandramohan', 'Lihui Chen', 'Yang Liu']|['cs.CR', 'cs.AI', 'cs.SE']

Without substantial domain knowledge, multivariate search queries often return sparse or uninformative results. This paper introduces an approach for searching structured data based on probabilistic programming and nonparametric Bayes. Users specify queries in a probabilistic language that combines standard SQL database search operators with an information theoretic ranking function called predictive relevance. Predictive relevance can be calculated by a fast sparse matrix algorithm based on posterior samples from CrossCat, a nonparametric Bayesian model for high-dimensional, heterogeneously-typed data tables. The result is a flexible search technique that applies to a broad class of information retrieval problems, which we integrate into BayesDB, a probabilistic programming platform for probabilistic data analysis. This paper demonstrates applications to databases of US colleges, global macroeconomic indicators of public health, and classic cars.

In fact, in the real-world applications, both cases may occur that some label correlations are globally applicable and some are shared only in a local group of instances. Moreover, it is also a usual case that only partial labels are observed, which makes the exploitation of the label correlations much more difficult.

Theory of Mind is critical to effective communication and to teams demonstrating higher collective performance. To effectively leverage the progress in Artificial Intelligence (AI) to make our lives more productive, it is important for humans and AI to work well together in a team. Traditionally, there has been much emphasis on research to make AI more accurate, and (to a lesser extent) on having it better understand human intentions, tendencies, beliefs, and contexts. The latter involves making AI more human-like and having it develop a theory of our minds.   In this work, we argue that for human-AI teams to be effective, humans must also develop a theory of AI's mind - get to know its strengths, weaknesses, beliefs, and quirks. We instantiate these ideas within the domain of Visual Question Answering (VQA). We find that using just a few examples(50), lay people can be trained to better predict responses and oncoming failures of a complex VQA model. Surprisingly, we find that having access to the model's internal states - its confidence in its top-k predictions, explicit or implicit attention maps which highlight regions in the image (and words in the question) the model is looking at (and listening to) while answering a question about an image - do not help people better predict its behavior|theori mind abil attribut mental state belief intent knowledg perspect etc recogn mental state may differ one theori mind critic effect communic team demonstr higher collect perform effect leverag progress artifici intellig ai make live product import human ai work well togeth team tradit much emphasi research make ai accur lesser extent better understand human intent tendenc belief context latter involv make ai human like develop theori mind work argu human ai team effect human must also develop theori ai mind get know strength weak belief quirk instanti idea within domain visual question answer vqa find use exampl lay peopl train better predict respons oncom failur complex vqa model surpris find access model intern state confid top predict explicit implicit attent map highlight region imag word question model look listen answer question imag help peopl better predict behavior|['Arjun Chandrasekaran', 'Deshraj Yadav', 'Prithvijit Chattopadhyay', 'Viraj Prabhu', 'Devi Parikh']|['cs.CV', 'cs.AI', 'cs.CL']

In this paper, we investigate a vision-language embedding as a core representation and show that it leads to better cross-task transfer than standard multi-task learning. In particular, the task of visual recognition is aligned to the task of visual question answering by forcing each to use the same word-region embeddings. We show this leads to greater inductive transfer from recognition to VQA than standard multitask learning.

Motivated by this observation, we propose the Ontological Multidimensional Data Model (OMD model), which can be used to model and represent contexts as logic-based ontologies. The data under assessment is mapped into the context, for additional analysis, processing, and quality data extraction. The resulting contexts allow for the representation of dimensions, and multidimensional data quality assessment becomes possible. At the core of a multidimensional context we include a generalized multidimensional data model and a Datalog+/- ontology with provably good properties in terms of query answering. These main components are used to represent dimension hierarchies, dimensional constraints, dimensional rules, and define predicates for quality data specification. Query answering relies upon and triggers navigation through dimension hierarchies, and becomes the basic tool for the extraction of quality data. The OMD model is interesting per se, beyond applications to data quality. It allows for a logic-based, and computationally tractable representation of multidimensional data, extending previous multidimensional data models with additional expressive power and functionalities.|data qualiti assess data clean context depend activ motiv observ propos ontolog multidimension data model omd model use model repres context logic base ontolog data assess map context addit analysi process qualiti data extract result context allow represent dimens multidimension data qualiti assess becom possibl core multidimension context includ general multidimension data model datalog ontolog provabl good properti term queri answer main compon use repres dimens hierarchi dimension constraint dimension rule defin predic qualiti data specif queri answer reli upon trigger navig dimens hierarchi becom basic tool extract qualiti data omd model interest per se beyond applic data qualiti allow logic base comput tractabl represent multidimension data extend previous multidimension data model addit express power function|['Leopoldo Bertossi', 'Mostafa Milani']|['cs.DB', 'cs.AI']

These changes, referred to as concept drift, can cause the predictive performance of the classifier to drop over time, thereby making it obsolete. To be of any real use, these classifiers need to detect drifts and be able to adapt to them, over time. Detecting drifts has traditionally been approached as a supervised task, with labeled data constantly being used for validating the learned model. Although effective in detecting drifts, these techniques are impractical, as labeling is a difficult, costly and time consuming activity. On the other hand, unsupervised change detection techniques are unreliable, as they produce a large number of false alarms. The inefficacy of the unsupervised techniques stems from the exclusion of the characteristics of the learned classifier, from the detection process. In this paper, we propose the Margin Density Drift Detection (MD3) algorithm, which tracks the number of samples in the uncertainty region of a classifier, as a metric to detect drift. The MD3 algorithm is a distribution independent, application independent, model independent, unsupervised and incremental algorithm for reliably detecting drifts from data streams. Experimental evaluation on 6 drift induced datasets and 4 additional datasets from the cybersecurity domain demonstrates that the MD3 approach can reliably detect drifts, with significantly fewer false alarms compared to unsupervised feature based drift detectors. The reduced false alarms enables the signaling of drifts only when they are most likely to affect classification performance. As such, the MD3 approach leads to a detection scheme which is credible, label efficient and general in its applicability.|classifi deploy real world oper dynam environ data distribut chang time chang refer concept drift caus predict perform classifi drop time therebi make obsolet ani real use classifi need detect drift abl adapt time detect drift tradit approach supervis task label data constant use valid learn model although effect detect drift techniqu impract label difficult cost time consum activ hand unsupervis chang detect techniqu unreli produc larg number fals alarm inefficaci unsupervis techniqu stem exclus characterist learn classifi detect process paper propos margin densiti drift detect md algorithm track number sampl uncertainti region classifi metric detect drift md algorithm distribut independ applic independ model independ unsupervis increment algorithm reliabl detect drift data stream experiment evalu drift induc dataset addit dataset cybersecur domain demonstr md approach reliabl detect drift signific fewer fals alarm compar unsupervis featur base drift detector reduc fals alarm enabl signal drift onli like affect classif perform md approach lead detect scheme credibl label effici general applic|['Tegjyot Singh Sethi', 'Mehmed Kantardzic']|['stat.ML', 'cs.AI', 'cs.LG']

Standard visual servoing approaches typically rely on manually designed features and analytical dynamics models, which limits their generalization capability and often requires extensive application-specific feature and model engineering. In this work, we study how learned visual features, learned predictive dynamics models, and reinforcement learning can be combined to learn visual servoing mechanisms. We focus on target following, with the goal of designing algorithms that can learn a visual servo using low amounts of data of the target in question, to enable quick adaptation to new targets. Our approach is based on servoing the camera in the space of learned visual features, rather than image pixels or manually-designed keypoints. We demonstrate that standard deep features, in our case taken from a model trained for object classification, can be used together with a bilinear predictive model to learn an effective visual servo that is robust to visual variation, changes in viewing angle and appearance, and occlusions. A key component of our approach is to use a sample-efficient fitted Q-iteration algorithm to learn which features are best suited for the task at hand. We show that we can learn an effective visual servo on a complex synthetic car following benchmark using just 20 training trajectory samples for reinforcement learning. We demonstrate substantial improvement over a conventional approach based on image pixels or hand-designed keypoints, and we show an improvement in sample-efficiency of more than two orders of magnitude over standard model-free deep reinforcement learning algorithms.

Sophisticated Android malware employ detection avoidance techniques in order to hide their malicious activities from analysis tools. These include a wide range of anti-emulator techniques, where the malware programs attempt to hide their malicious activities by detecting the emulator. For this reason, countermeasures against antiemulation are becoming increasingly important in Android malware detection. Analysis and detection based on real devices can alleviate the problems of anti-emulation as well as improve the effectiveness of dynamic analysis. Hence, in this paper we present an investigation of machine learning based malware detection using dynamic analysis on real devices. A tool is implemented to automatically extract dynamic features from Android phones and through several experiments, a comparative analysis of emulator based vs. device based detection by means of several machine learning algorithms is undertaken. Our study shows that several features could be extracted more effectively from the on-device dynamic analysis compared to emulators. It was also found that approximately 24% more apps were successfully analysed on the phone.

MidiNet can generate music of arbitrary number of bars, by concatenating these 16 by 128 matrices. The melody sequence can then be played back with a synthesizer.

Ideally, we answer our question using an experiment, but this is not always possible (e.g., it may be unethical). As an alternative, we can use non-experimental data to learn models that make counterfactual predictions of what we would observe had we run an experiment. In this paper, we propose a model to make counterfactual predictions about how continuous-time trajectories (time series) respond to sequences of actions taken in continuous-time. We develop our model within the potential outcomes framework of Neyman and Rubin. One challenge is that the assumptions commonly made to learn potential outcome (counterfactual) models from observational data are not applicable in continuous-time as-is. We therefore propose a model using marked point processes and Gaussian processes, and develop alternative assumptions that allow us to learn counterfactual models from continuous-time observational data.

However, for getting grades for complex tasks, which require specific skills and efforts for grading, crowdsourcing encounters a restriction of insufficient knowledge of the workers from the crowd. Due to knowledge limitation of the crowd graders, grading based on partial perspectives becomes a big challenge for evaluating complex tasks through crowdsourcing. Especially for those tasks which not only need specific knowledge for grading, but also should be graded as a whole instead of being decomposed into smaller and simpler subtasks. We propose a framework for grading complex tasks via multiple views, which are different grading perspectives defined by experts for the task, to provide uniformity. Aggregation algorithm based on graders variances are used to combine the grades for each view. We also detect bias patterns of the graders, and debias them regarding each view of the task. Bias pattern determines how the behavior is biased among graders, which is detected by a statistical technique. The proposed approach is analyzed on a synthetic data set. We show that our model gives more accurate results compared to the grading approaches without different views and debiasing algorithm.|popular massiv open onlin cours grade crowdsourc becom preval approach toward larg scale class howev get grade complex task requir specif skill effort grade crowdsourc encount restrict insuffici knowledg worker crowd due knowledg limit crowd grader grade base partial perspect becom big challeng evalu complex task crowdsourc especi task onli need specif knowledg grade also grade whole instead decompos smaller simpler subtask propos framework grade complex task via multipl view differ grade perspect defin expert task provid uniform aggreg algorithm base grader varianc use combin grade view also detect bias pattern grader debia regard view task bias pattern determin behavior bias among grader detect statist techniqu propos approach analyz synthet data set show model give accur result compar grade approach without differ view debias algorithm|['Lingyu Lyu', 'Mehmed Kantardzic']|['cs.AI', 'cs.HC']

However, many untrustworthy users give fraudulent ratings for excessive monetary gains. In the paper, we present FairJudge, a system to identify such fraudulent users. We propose three metrics: (i) the fairness of a user that quantifies how trustworthy the user is in rating the products, (ii) the reliability of a rating that measures how reliable the rating is, and (iii) the goodness of a product that measures the quality of the product. Intuitively, a user is fair if it provides reliable ratings that are close to the goodness of the product. We formulate a mutually recursive definition of these metrics, and further address cold start problems and incorporate behavioral properties of users and products in the formulation. We propose an iterative algorithm, FairJudge, to predict the values of the three metrics. We prove that FairJudge is guaranteed to converge in a bounded number of iterations, with linear time complexity. By conducting five different experiments on five rating platforms, we show that FairJudge significantly outperforms nine existing algorithms in predicting fair and unfair users. We reported the 100 most unfair users in the Flipkart network to their review fraud investigators, and 80 users were correctly identified (80% accuracy).

Furthermore, humans -- rightfully so -- generate multiple, diverse captions, due to the inherent ambiguity in the captioning task which is not considered in today's systems.   To address these challenges, we change the training objective of the caption generator from reproducing groundtruth captions to generating a set of captions that is indistinguishable from human generated captions. Instead of handcrafting such a learning target, we employ adversarial training in combination with an approximate Gumbel sampler to implicitly match the generated distribution to the human one.

The resulting algorithm configuration (AC) problem has attracted much attention from the machine learning community. However, the proper evaluation of new AC procedures is hindered by two key hurdles. First, AC benchmarks are hard to set up. Second and even more significantly, they are computationally expensive: a single run of an AC procedure involves many costly runs of the target algorithm whose performance is to be optimized in a given AC benchmark scenario. One common workaround is to optimize cheap-to-evaluate artificial benchmark functions (e.g., Branin) instead of actual algorithms; however, these have different properties than realistic AC problems. Here, we propose an alternative benchmarking approach that is similarly cheap to evaluate but much closer to the original AC problem: replacing expensive benchmarks by surrogate benchmarks constructed from AC benchmarks.

Translating embedding methods regard relations as the translation from head entities to tail entities, which achieve the state-of-the-art results among knowledge graph embedding methods. However, a major limitation of these methods is the time consuming training process, which may take several days or even weeks for large knowledge graphs, and result in great difficulty in practical applications. In this paper, we propose an efficient parallel framework for translating embedding methods, called ParTrans-X, which enables the methods to be paralleled without locks by utilizing the distinguished structures of knowledge graphs. Experiments on two datasets with three typical translating embedding methods, i.e., TransE [3], TransH [17], and a more efficient variant TransE- AdaGrad [10] validate that ParTrans-X can speed up the training process by more than an order of magnitude.|knowledg graph embed aim emb entiti relat knowledg graph low dimension vector space translat embed method regard relat translat head entiti tail entiti achiev state art result among knowledg graph embed method howev major limit method time consum train process may take sever day even week larg knowledg graph result great difficulti practic applic paper propos effici parallel framework translat embed method call partran enabl method parallel without lock util distinguish structur knowledg graph experi two dataset three typic translat embed method trans transh effici variant trans adagrad valid partran speed train process order magnitud|['Denghui Zhang', 'Manling Li', 'Yantao Jia', 'Yuanzhuo Wang']|['cs.AI', 'I.2.4']

The key contribution of this paper is to formulate the task as a Multi-Armed Bandit problem, with each arm representing a model of the deformable object. To ""pull"" an arm and evaluate its utility, we use the arm's model to generate a velocity command for the gripper(s) holding the object and execute it. As the task proceeds and the object deforms, the utility of each model can change. Our framework estimates these changes and balances exploration of the model set with exploitation of high-utility models. We also propose an approach based on Kalman Filtering for Non-stationary Multi-armed Normal Bandits (KF-MANB) to leverage the coupling between models to learn more from each arm pull.

The problem is about the existence of rough basis for given approximations in a context. Granular operator spaces were recently introduced by the present author as an optimal framework for anti-chain based algebraic semantics of general rough sets and the inverse problem. In the framework, various subtypes of crisp and non crisp objects are identifiable that may be missed in more restrictive formalism. This is also because in the latter cases the concept of complementation and negation are taken for granted. This opens the door for a general approach to dialectical rough sets building on previous work of the present author and figures of opposition. In this paper dialectical rough logics are developed from a semantic perspective, concept of dialectical predicates is formalized, connection with dialethias and glutty negation established, parthood analyzed and studied from the point of view of classical and dialectical figures of opposition. Potential semantics through dialectical counting based on these figures are proposed building on earlier work by the present author. Her methods become more geometrical and encompass parthood as a primary relation (as opposed to roughly equivalent objects) for algebraic semantics. Dialectical counting strategies over anti chains (a specific form of dialectical structure) for semantics are also proposed.|one perspect central problem pursu research invers problem context general rough set problem exist rough basi given approxim context granular oper space recent introduc present author optim framework anti chain base algebra semant general rough set invers problem framework various subtyp crisp non crisp object identifi may miss restrict formal also becaus latter case concept complement negat taken grant open door general approach dialect rough set build previous work present author figur opposit paper dialect rough logic develop semant perspect concept dialect predic formal connect dialethia glutti negat establish parthood analyz studi point view classic dialect figur opposit potenti semant dialect count base figur propos build earlier work present author method becom geometr encompass parthood primari relat oppos rough equival object algebra semant dialect count strategi anti chain specif form dialect structur semant also propos|['A.

After discovering the alignment by methods, several performance scores are available to evaluate them. The scores require the produced alignment by a method and the reference alignment containing the underlying actual correspondences of the given ontologies. The current trend in alignment evaluation is to put forward a new score and to compare various alignments by juxtaposing their performance scores. However, it is substantially provocative to select one performance score among others for comparison. On top of that, claiming if one method has a better performance than one another can not be substantiated by solely comparing the scores. In this paper, we propose the statistical procedures which enable us to theoretically favor one method over one another. The McNemar test is considered as a reliable and suitable means for comparing two ontology alignment methods over one matching task. The test applies to a 2 x 2 contingency table which can be constructed in two different ways based on the alignments, each of which has their own merits/pitfalls. The ways of the contingency table construction and various apposite statistics from the McNemar test are elaborated in minute detail. In the case of having more than two alignment methods for comparison, the family-wise error rate is expected to happen. Thus, the ways of preventing such an error are also discussed. A directed graph visualizes the outcome of the McNemar test in the presence of multiple alignment methods. From this graph, it is readily understood if one method is better than one another or if their differences are imperceptible. Our investigation on the methods participated in the anatomy track of OAEI 2016 demonstrates that AML and CroMatcher are the top two methods and DKP-AOM and Alin are the bottom two ones.|ontolog align wide use find correspond differ ontolog divers field discov align method sever perform score avail evalu score requir produc align method refer align contain actual correspond given ontolog current trend align evalu put forward new score compar various align juxtapos perform score howev substanti provoc select one perform score among comparison top claim one method better perform one anoth substanti sole compar score paper propos statist procedur enabl us theoret favor one method one anoth mcnemar test consid reliabl suitabl mean compar two ontolog align method one match task test appli conting tabl construct two differ way base align merit pitfal way conting tabl construct various apposit statist mcnemar test elabor minut detail case two align method comparison famili wise error rate expect happen thus way prevent error also discuss direct graph visual outcom mcnemar test presenc multipl align method graph readili understood one method better one anoth differ impercept investig method particip anatomi track oaei demonstr aml cromatch top two method dkp aom alin bottom two one|['Majid Mohammadi', 'Amir Ahooye Atashin', 'Wout Hofman', 'Yaohua Tan']|['cs.AI']

In this paper, we take StarCraft combat game as the test scenario, where the task is to coordinate multiple agents as a team to defeat their enemies. To maintain a scalable yet effective communication protocol, we introduce a multiagent bidirectionally-coordinated network (BiCNet ['bIknet]) with a vectorised extension of actor-critic formulation. We show that BiCNet can handle different types of combats under diverse terrains with arbitrary numbers of AI agents for both sides. Our analysis demonstrates that without any supervisions such as human demonstrations or labelled data, BiCNet could learn various types of coordination strategies that is similar to these of experienced game players. Moreover, BiCNet is easily adaptable to the tasks with heterogeneous agents.

Recently, it has been proved that the SPL regime has a close relationship to a implicit self-paced objective function. While this implicit objective could provide helpful interpretations to the effectiveness, especially the robustness, insights under the SPL paradigms, there are still no theoretical results strictly proved to verify such relationship. To this issue, in this paper, we provide some convergence results on this implicit objective of SPL.

This challenge is approached by introducing a constraint for pattern selection. One of the first constraints proposed in pattern mining is support (frequency) of a pattern in a dataset. Frequency is an anti-monotonic function, i.e., given an infrequent pattern, all its superpatterns are not frequent. However, many other constraints for pattern selection are neither monotonic nor anti-monotonic, which makes it difficult to generate patterns satisfying these constraints.   In order to deal with nonmonotonic constraints we introduce the notion of ""projection antimonotonicity"" and SOFIA algorithm that allow generating best patterns for a class of nonmonotonic constraints. Cosine interest, robustness, stability of closed itemsets, and the associated delta-measure are among these constraints. SOFIA starts from light descriptions of transactions in dataset (a small set of items in the case of itemset description) and then iteratively adds more information to these descriptions (more items with indication of tidsets they describe)."|exponenti explos set pattern one main challeng pattern mine challeng approach introduc constraint pattern select one first constraint propos pattern mine support frequenc pattern dataset frequenc anti monoton function given infrequ pattern superpattern frequent howev mani constraint pattern select neither monoton anti monoton make difficult generat pattern satisfi constraint order deal nonmonoton constraint introduc notion project antimonoton sofia algorithm allow generat best pattern class nonmonoton constraint cosin interest robust stabil close itemset associ delta measur among constraint sofia start light descript transact dataset small set item case itemset descript iter add inform descript item indic tidset describ|['Aleksey Buzmakov', 'Sergei O.

Especially the prospect of overcoming the need for manual feature design combined with superior classification capabilities render deep neural networks very attractive for real-life HAR application. Even though DL-based approaches now outperform the state-of-the-art in a number of recognitions tasks of the field, yet substantial challenges remain. Most prominently, issues with real-life datasets, typically including imbalanced datasets and problematic data quality, still limit the effectiveness of activity recognition using wearables. In this paper we tackle such challenges through Ensembles of deep Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks. We have developed modified training procedures for LSTM networks and combine sets of diverse LSTM learners into classifier collectives. We demonstrate, both formally and empirically, that Ensembles of deep LSTM learners outperform the individual LSTM networks.

By Incorporating a Boltzmann machine into the potential function of a Markov network, we investigated the joint probability distribution of the MKN.

This allows a learning engine to sample full-combat simulations at parameter values that are most likely to optimize performance and also provide highly informative data points for improving future predictions. However, standard GPBO methods do not provide a reliable surrogate model for the highly volatile objective functions found in aerial combat, and thus do not reliably identify global maxima. These issues are addressed by novel Repeat Sampling (RS) and Hybrid Repeat/Multi-point Sampling (HRMS) techniques.

We introduce a new variant called Intelligent Bidirectional-RRT* (IB-RRT*) which is an improved variant of the optimal RRT* and bidirectional version of RRT* (B-RRT*) algorithms and is specially designed for complex cluttered environments.

The goal in this paper is to automate $\mathcal{DDE}$. We briefly present $\mathcal{DDE}$, and use a first-order modal logic, the deontic cognitive event calculus, as our framework to formalize the doctrine. We present formalizations of increasingly stronger versions of the principle, including what is known as the doctrine of triple effect. We then use our framework to simulate successfully scenarios that have been used to test for the presence of the principle in human subjects. Our framework can be used in two different modes: One can use it to build $\mathcal{DDE}$-compliant autonomous systems from scratch, or one can use it to verify that a given AI system is $\mathcal{DDE}$-compliant, by applying a $\mathcal{DDE}$ layer on an existing system or model. For the latter mode, the underlying AI system can be built using any architecture (planners, deep neural networks, bayesian networks, knowledge-representation systems, or a hybrid); as long as the system exposes a few parameters in its model, such verification is possible. The role of the $\mathcal{DDE}$ layer here is akin to a (dynamic or static) software verifier that examines existing software modules. Finally, we end by presenting initial work on how one can apply our $\mathcal{DDE}$ layer to the STRIPS-style planning model, and to a modified POMDP model.|doctrin doubl effect mathcal dde long studi ethic principl govern action posit negat effect allow goal paper autom mathcal dde briefli present mathcal dde use first order modal logic deontic cognit event calculus framework formal doctrin present formal increas stronger version principl includ known doctrin tripl effect use framework simul success scenario use test presenc principl human subject framework use two differ mode one use build mathcal dde compliant autonom system scratch one use verifi given ai system mathcal dde compliant appli mathcal dde layer exist system model latter mode ai system built use ani architectur planner deep neural network bayesian network knowledg represent system hybrid long system expos paramet model verif possibl role mathcal dde layer akin dynam static softwar verifi examin exist softwar modul final end present initi work one appli mathcal dde layer strip style plan model modifi pomdp model|['Naveen Sundar Govindarajulu', 'Selmer Bringsjord']|['cs.AI', 'cs.LO', 'cs.RO']

However, while instinctive to humans, socially compliant navigation is still difficult to quantify due to the stochasticity in people's behaviors. Existing works are mostly focused on using feature-matching techniques to describe and imitate human paths, but often do not generalize well since the feature values can vary from person to person, and even run to run. This work notes that while it is challenging to directly specify the details of what to do (precise mechanisms of human navigation), it is straightforward to specify what not to do (violations of social norms). Specifically, using deep reinforcement learning, this work develops a time-efficient navigation policy that respects common social norms.

Patient phenotyping is a classification task for determining whether a patient has a medical condition, and is a crucial part of secondary analysis of healthcare data. We assess the performance of deep learning algorithms and compare them with classical NLP approaches.   Materials and Methods: We compare convolutional neural networks (CNNs), n-gram models, and approaches based on cTAKES that extract pre-defined medical concepts from clinical notes and use them to predict patient phenotypes. The performance is tested on 10 different phenotyping tasks using 1,610 discharge summaries extracted from the MIMIC-III database.   Results: CNNs outperform other phenotyping algorithms in all 10 tasks. The average F1-score of our model is 76 (PPV of 83, and sensitivity of 71) with our model having an F1-score up to 37 points higher than alternative approaches. We additionally assess the interpretability of our model by presenting a method that extracts the most salient phrases for a particular prediction.   Conclusion: We show that NLP methods based on deep learning improve the performance of patient phenotyping. Our CNN-based algorithm automatically learns the phrases associated with each patient phenotype. As such, it reduces the annotation complexity for clinical domain experts, who are normally required to develop task-specific annotation rules and identify relevant phrases. Our method performs well in terms of both performance and interpretability, which indicates that deep learning is an effective approach to patient phenotyping based on clinicians' notes.|object investig whether deep learn techniqu natur languag process nlp use effici patient phenotyp patient phenotyp classif task determin whether patient medic condit crucial part secondari analysi healthcar data assess perform deep learn algorithm compar classic nlp approach materi method compar convolut neural network cnns gram model approach base ctake extract pre defin medic concept clinic note use predict patient phenotyp perform test differ phenotyp task use discharg summari extract mimic iii databas result cnns outperform phenotyp algorithm task averag score model ppv sensit model score point higher altern approach addit assess interpret model present method extract salient phrase particular predict conclus show nlp method base deep learn improv perform patient phenotyp cnn base algorithm automat learn phrase associ patient phenotyp reduc annot complex clinic domain expert normal requir develop task specif annot rule identifi relev phrase method perform well term perform interpret indic deep learn effect approach patient phenotyp base clinician note|['Sebastian Gehrmann', 'Franck Dernoncourt', 'Yeran Li', 'Eric T.

In an experiment run on more than 4000 batched orders with 1 to 150 items per batch, the storage assignment suggested by the algorithm produces a 21\% reduction in the total retrieval time with respect to a frequency-based storage assignment.|propos simul anneal algorithm specif tailor optimis total retriev time multi level warehous complex pre batch pick constraint experi real data picker part order pick process warehous european manufactur show optim storag assign necessarili display featur presum heurist cluster posit correl item order item pick frequenc experi run batch order item per batch storag assign suggest algorithm produc reduct total retriev time respect frequenc base storag assign|['Alexander Eckrot', 'Carina Geldhauser', 'Jan Jurczyk']|['cs.AI']

To resolve this problem, we propose the incremental moment matching (IMM), which uses the Bayesian neural network framework. IMM assumes that the posterior distribution of parameters of neural networks is approximated with Gaussian distribution and incrementally matches the moment of the posteriors, which are trained for the first and second task, respectively. To make our Gaussian assumption reasonable, the IMM procedure utilizes various transfer learning techniques including weight transfer, L2-norm of old and new parameters, and a newly proposed variant of dropout using old parameters. We analyze our methods on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, and then evaluate them on a real-world life-log dataset collected using Google Glass. Experimental results show that IMM produces state-of-the-art performance in a variety of datasets.|catastroph forget problem refer lose inform first task train second task continu learn neural network resolv problem propos increment moment match imm use bayesian neural network framework imm assum posterior distribut paramet neural network approxim gaussian distribut increment match moment posterior train first second task respect make gaussian assumpt reason imm procedur util various transfer learn techniqu includ weight transfer norm old new paramet newli propos variant dropout use old paramet analyz method mnist cifar dataset evalu real world life log dataset collect use googl glass experiment result show imm produc state art perform varieti dataset|['Sang-Woo Lee', 'Jin-Hwa Kim', 'Jung-Woo Ha', 'Byoung-Tak Zhang']|['cs.LG', 'cs.AI']

Consequently, busy people spend a significant amount of time scheduling meetings. We present Calendar.help, a system that provides fast, efficient scheduling through structured workflows. Users interact with the system via email, delegating their scheduling needs to the system as if it were a human personal assistant. Common scheduling scenarios are broken down using well-defined workflows and completed as a series of microtasks that are automated when possible and executed by a human otherwise. Unusual scenarios fall back to a trained human assistant who executes them as unstructured macrotasks. We describe the iterative approach we used to develop Calendar.help, and share the lessons learned from scheduling thousands of meetings during a year of real-world deployments. Our findings provide insight into how complex information tasks can be broken down into repeatable components that can be executed efficiently to improve productivity.|although inform worker may complain meet essenti part work life consequ busi peopl spend signific amount time schedul meet present calendar help system provid fast effici schedul structur workflow user interact system via email deleg schedul need system human person assist common schedul scenario broken use well defin workflow complet seri microtask autom possibl execut human otherwis unusu scenario fall back train human assist execut unstructur macrotask describ iter approach use develop calendar help share lesson learn schedul thousand meet dure year real world deploy find provid insight complex inform task broken repeat compon execut effici improv product|['Justin Cranshaw', 'Emad Elwany', 'Todd Newman', 'Rafal Kocielnik', 'Bowen Yu', 'Sandeep Soni', 'Jaime Teevan', 'Andr√©s Monroy-Hern√°ndez']|['cs.HC', 'cs.AI', 'cs.CL']

There are many techniques to address this, including data augmentation, dropout, and transfer learning. In this paper, we introduce an additional method which we call Smart Augmentation and we show how to use it to increase the accuracy and reduce overfitting on a target network. Smart Augmentation works by creating a network that learns how to generate augmented data during the training process of a target network in a way that reduces that networks loss. This allows us to learn augmentations that minimize the error of that network.   Smart Augmentation has shown the potential to increase accuracy by demonstrably significant measures on all datasets tested. In addition, it has shown potential to achieve similar or improved performance levels with significantly smaller network sizes in a number of tested cases.|recur problem face train neural network typic enough data maxim general capabl deep neural network dnn mani techniqu address includ data augment dropout transfer learn paper introduc addit method call smart augment show use increas accuraci reduc overfit target network smart augment work creat network learn generat augment data dure train process target network way reduc network loss allow us learn augment minim error network smart augment shown potenti increas accuraci demonstr signific measur dataset test addit shown potenti achiev similar improv perform level signific smaller network size number test case|['Joseph Lemley', 'Shabab Bazrafkan', 'Peter Corcoran']|['cs.AI', 'cs.LG', 'stat.ML']

However, its comprehensiveness makes the planning and control in POMDP difficult. Traditional POMDP planning problems target to find the optimal policy to maximize the expectation of accumulated rewards. But for safety critical applications, guarantees of system performance described by formal specifications are desired, which motivates us to consider formal methods to synthesize supervisor for POMDP. With system specifications given by Probabilistic Computation Tree Logic (PCTL), we propose a supervisory control framework with a type of deterministic finite automata (DFA), za-DFA, as the controller form. While the existing work mainly relies on optimization techniques to learn fixed-size finite state controllers (FSCs), we develop an $L^*$ learning based algorithm to determine both space and transitions of za-DFA. Membership queries and different oracles for conjectures are defined. The learning algorithm is sound and complete. An example is given in detailed steps to illustrate the supervisor synthesis algorithm.|general thus popular model autonom system partial observ markov decis process pomdp captur uncertainti differ sourc like sens nois actuat error uncertain environ howev comprehens make plan control pomdp difficult tradit pomdp plan problem target find optim polici maxim expect accumul reward safeti critic applic guarante system perform describ formal specif desir motiv us consid formal method synthes supervisor pomdp system specif given probabilist comput tree logic pctl propos supervisori control framework type determinist finit automata dfa za dfa control form exist work main reli optim techniqu learn fix size finit state control fscs develop learn base algorithm determin space transit za dfa membership queri differ oracl conjectur defin learn algorithm sound complet exampl given detail step illustr supervisor synthesi algorithm|['Xiaobin Zhang', 'Bo Wu', 'Hai Lin']|['cs.SY', 'cs.AI', 'cs.FL']

Previous work on texture generation focused on either synthesis from examples or generation from procedural models. Generating textures from perceptual attributes have not been well studied yet. Meanwhile, perceptual attributes, such as directionality, regularity and roughness are important factors for human observers to describe a texture. In this paper, we propose a joint deep network model that combines adversarial training and perceptual feature regression for texture generation, while only random noise and user-defined perceptual attributes are required as input. In this model, a preliminary trained convolutional neural network is essentially integrated with the adversarial framework, which can drive the generated textures to possess given perceptual attributes. An important aspect of the proposed model is that, if we change one of the input perceptual features, the corresponding appearance of the generated textures will also be changed. We design several experiments to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results show that the proposed method can produce high quality texture images with desired perceptual properties.|paper investig novel task generat textur imag perceptu descript previous work textur generat focus either synthesi exampl generat procedur model generat textur perceptu attribut well studi yet meanwhil perceptu attribut direct regular rough import factor human observ describ textur paper propos joint deep network model combin adversari train perceptu featur regress textur generat onli random nois user defin perceptu attribut requir input model preliminari train convolut neural network essenti integr adversari framework drive generat textur possess given perceptu attribut import aspect propos model chang one input perceptu featur correspond appear generat textur also chang design sever experi valid effect propos method result show propos method produc high qualiti textur imag desir perceptu properti|['Yanhai Gan', 'Huifang Chi', 'Ying Gao', 'Jun Liu', 'Guoqiang Zhong', 'Junyu Dong']|['cs.CV', 'cs.AI', 'cs.LG']

Because performed note durations can deviate largely from score-indicated values, previous methods had the problem of not being able to accurately estimate offset score times (or note values) and thus could only output incomplete musical scores. Based on observations that the pitch context and onset score times are influential on the configuration of note values, we construct a context-tree model that provides prior distributions of note values using these features and combine it with a performance model in the framework of Markov random fields. Evaluation results showed that our method reduces the average error rate by around 40 percent compared to existing/simple methods. We also confirmed that, in our model, the score model plays a more important role than the performance model, and it automatically captures the voice structure by unsupervised learning.|paper present statist method music transcript estim score time note onset offset polyphon midi perform signal becaus perform note durat deviat larg score indic valu previous method problem abl accur estim offset score time note valu thus could onli output incomplet music score base observ pitch context onset score time influenti configur note valu construct context tree model provid prior distribut note valu use featur combin perform model framework markov random field evalu result show method reduc averag error rate around percent compar exist simpl method also confirm model score model play import role perform model automat captur voic structur unsupervis learn|['Eita Nakamura', 'Kazuyoshi Yoshii', 'Simon Dixon']|['cs.AI', 'cs.SD']
