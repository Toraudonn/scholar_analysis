In a networked game each player (user) takes action in response to other players' actions in order to decrease (increase) his cost (profit) in the network. We assume that the players' cost functions are not necessarily dependent on the actions of all players. This is due to better mimicking the standard social media rules. A communication graph is defined for the game through which players are able to share their information with only their neighbors. We assume that the communication neighbors necessarily affect the players' cost functions while the reverse is not always true. In this game, the players are only aware of their own cost functions and actions. Thus, each of them maintains an estimate of the others' actions and share it with the neighbors to update his action and estimates.|work investig applic nash equilibrium seek algorithm social network network game player user take action respons player action order decreas increas cost profit network assum player cost function necessarili depend action player due better mimick standard social media rule communic graph defin game player abl share inform onli neighbor assum communic neighbor necessarili affect player cost function revers alway true game player onli awar cost function action thus maintain estim action share neighbor updat action estim|['Farzad Salehisadaghiani']|['cs.GT', 'cs.SI', 'cs.SY']

This problem is known to be NP-hard in general. Our contribution is two fold: a polyhedral characterization and an approximation algorithm. Previously Chen et al. have shown that the stable matching polytope is integral if and only if the subgraph obtained after running phase one of Irving's algorithm is bipartite. We improve upon this result by showing that there are instances where this subgraph might not be bipartite but one can further eliminate some edges and arrive at a bipartite subgraph. Our elimination procedure ensures that the set of stable matchings remains the same, and thus the stable matching polytope of the final subgraph contains the incidence vectors of all stable matchings of our original graph. This allows us to characterize a larger class of instances for which the weighted stable matching problem is polynomial-time solvable. We also show that our edge elimination procedure is best possible, meaning that if the subgraph we arrive at is not bipartite, then there is no bipartite subgraph that has the same set of stable matchings as the original graph. We complement these results with a $2$-approximation algorithm for the minimum weight stable matching problem for instances where each agent has at most two possible partners in any stable matching. This is the first approximation result for any class of instances with general weights.|studi stabl match problem non bipartit graph incomplet strict prefer list edg weight goal comput stabl match minimum maximum weight problem known np hard general contribut two fold polyhedr character approxim algorithm previous chen et al shown stabl match polytop integr onli subgraph obtain run phase one irv algorithm bipartit improv upon result show instanc subgraph might bipartit one elimin edg arriv bipartit subgraph elimin procedur ensur set stabl match remain thus stabl match polytop final subgraph contain incid vector stabl match origin graph allow us character larger class instanc weight stabl match problem polynomi time solvabl also show edg elimin procedur best possibl mean subgraph arriv bipartit bipartit subgraph set stabl match origin graph complement result approxim algorithm minimum weight stabl match problem instanc agent two possibl partner ani stabl match first approxim result ani class instanc general weight|['Linda Farczadi', 'Natália Guričanová']|['cs.GT', 'cs.DS']

In many applications, such as dividing a land-estate or a time-interval, it is also important that the pieces are connected. We propose two additional requirements: resource-monotonicity (RM) and population-monotonicity (PM). When either the cake or the set of agents changes and the cake is re-divided using the same rule, the utility of all remaining agents must change in the same direction.   Classic cake-cutting protocols are neither RM nor PM. Moreover, we prove that no Pareto-optimal proportional division rule can be either RM or PM. Motivated by this negative result, we search for division rules that are weakly-Pareto-optimal --- no other division is strictly better for all agents.   We present two such rules. The relative-equitable rule, which assigns the maximum possible relative value equal for all agents, is proportional and PM. The so-called rightmost-mark rule, which is an improved version of the Cut and Choose protocol, is proportional and RM for two agents.|classic cake cut problem steinhaus heterogen resourc divid among agent differ valuat proport way give agent piec valu least total mani applic divid land estat time interv also import piec connect propos two addit requir resourc monoton rm popul monoton pm either cake set agent chang cake divid use rule util remain agent must chang direct classic cake cut protocol neither rm pm moreov prove pareto optim proport divis rule either rm pm motiv negat result search divis rule weak pareto optim divis strict better agent present two rule relat equit rule assign maximum possibl relat valu equal agent proport pm call rightmost mark rule improv version cut choos protocol proport rm two agent|['Erel Segal-Halevi', 'Balázs Sziklai']|['cs.GT']

But what are the reasons for this phenomenon? Is it that such relations are more convenient and easier to maintain? Or are there also some more tangible benefits to be gained from this collective behaviour?   The current work takes a game-theoretic perspective on this phenomenon, and studies the conditions under which different assortative mixing strategies lead to equilibrium in an evolving social network. We focus on a biased preferential attachment model where the strategy of each group (e.g., political or social minority) determines the level of bias of its members toward other group members and non-members. Our first result is that if the utility function that the group attempts to maximize is the degree centrality of the group, interpreted as the sum of degrees of the group members in the network, then the only strategy achieving Nash equilibrium is a perfect homophily, which implies that cooperation with other groups is harmful to this utility function. A second, and perhaps more surprising, result is that if a reward for inter-group cooperation is added to the utility function (e.g., externally enforced by an authority as a regulation), then there are only two possible equilibria, namely, perfect homophily or perfect heterophily, and it is possible to characterize their feasibility spaces. Interestingly, these results hold regardless of the minority-majority ratio in the population.   We believe that these results, as well as the game-theoretic perspective presented herein, may contribute to a better understanding of the forces that shape the groups and communities of our society.|known individu social network tend exhibit homophili assort mix social tie impli prefer bond kind reason phenomenon relat conveni easier maintain also tangibl benefit gain collect behaviour current work take game theoret perspect phenomenon studi condit differ assort mix strategi lead equilibrium evolv social network focus bias preferenti attach model strategi group polit social minor determin level bias member toward group member non member first result util function group attempt maxim degre central group interpret sum degre group member network onli strategi achiev nash equilibrium perfect homophili impli cooper group harm util function second perhap surpris result reward inter group cooper ad util function extern enforc author regul onli two possibl equilibria name perfect homophili perfect heterophili possibl character feasibl space interest result hold regardless minor major ratio popul believ result well game theoret perspect present herein may contribut better understand forc shape group communiti societi|['Chen Avin', 'Hadassa Daltrophe', 'Zvi Lotker', 'David Peleg']|['cs.SI', 'cs.GT', 'physics.soc-ph']

Specifically, we examine the impact of behavioral (mis)-perceptions of infection probabilities (captured by Prospect theory) on the Nash equilibrium strategies in two classes of games. In the first class of games, nodes choose their curing rates to minimize the steady-state infection probability under the degree-based mean-field approximation plus the cost of their selected curing rate. We establish the existence of pure Nash equilibria under both risk neutral and behavioral decision-makers. When the per-unit cost of curing rate is sufficiently high, we show that risk neutral players choose the curing rate to be zero at the equilibrium, while curing rate is nonzero under behavioral decision-making for any finite cost. In the second class of games, the nodes choose whether or not to vaccinate themselves. We establish the existence of unique threshold equilibria where nodes with degrees larger than a certain threshold vaccinate. When the vaccination cost is sufficiently high, fewer behavioral players vaccinate compared to risk neutral players, and vice versa. Finally, we provide a rigorous comparison of the equilibrium thresholds under behavioral and risk neutral players in networks with power-law degree distributions.|studi decentr protect strategi human decis maker suscept infect suscept sis epidem network specif examin impact behavior mis percept infect probabl captur prospect theori nash equilibrium strategi two class game first class game node choos cure rate minim steadi state infect probabl degre base mean field approxim plus cost select cure rate establish exist pure nash equilibria risk neutral behavior decis maker per unit cost cure rate suffici high show risk neutral player choos cure rate zero equilibrium cure rate nonzero behavior decis make ani finit cost second class game node choos whether vaccin themselv establish exist uniqu threshold equilibria node degre larger certain threshold vaccin vaccin cost suffici high fewer behavior player vaccin compar risk neutral player vice versa final provid rigor comparison equilibrium threshold behavior risk neutral player network power law degre distribut|['Ashish R.

With the advancement in technologies (such as video conferencing, smartphone, etc.), it has become reality that, for the critical medical cases in the hospitals, expert consultants (ECs) from around the world could be hired, who will serve the patients by their physical or virtual presence. Earlier, this interesting healthcare scenario of hiring the ECs (mainly doctors) from outside of the hospitals had been studied with the robust concepts of mechanism design with or without money. We have tried to model the ECs (mainly doctors) hiring problem as a two-sided matching problem. In this paper, for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, we explore the more realistic two-sided matching in our set-up, where the members of the two participating communities, namely patients and doctors are revealing the strict preference ordering over all the members of the opposite community for a stipulated amount of time. We assume that patients and doctors are strategic in nature. With the theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that the proposed mechanism that results in a stable allocation of doctors to patients is strategy-proof (or truthful) and optimal.

In a game-theoretic context, substitutes capture diminishing marginal value of information to a rational decision maker. We use the definitions to address the question of how and when information is aggregated in prediction markets. Substitutes characterize ""best-possible"" equilibria with immediate information aggregation, while complements characterize ""worst-possible"", delayed aggregation. Game-theoretic applications also include settings such as crowdsourcing contests and Q\&A forums. In an algorithmic context, where substitutes capture diminishing marginal improvement of information to an optimization problem, substitutes imply efficient approximation algorithms for a very general class of (adaptive) information acquisition problems.   In tandem with these broad applications, we examine the structure and design of informational substitutes and complements. They have equivalent, intuitive definitions from disparate perspectives: submodularity, geometry, and information theory. We also consider the design of scoring rules or optimization problems so as to encourage substitutability or complementarity, with positive and negative results. Taken as a whole, the results give some evidence that, in parallel with substitutable items, informational substitutes play a natural conceptual and formal role in game theory and algorithms."|propos definit substitut complement piec inform signal context decis optim problem game theoret algorithm applic game theoret context substitut captur diminish margin valu inform ration decis maker use definit address question inform aggreg predict market substitut character best possibl equilibria immedi inform aggreg complement character worst possibl delay aggreg game theoret applic also includ set crowdsourc contest forum algorithm context substitut captur diminish margin improv inform optim problem substitut impli effici approxim algorithm veri general class adapt inform acquisit problem tandem broad applic examin structur design inform substitut complement equival intuit definit dispar perspect submodular geometri inform theori also consid design score rule optim problem encourag substitut complementar posit negat result taken whole result give evid parallel substitut item inform substitut play natur conceptu formal role game theori algorithm|['Yiling Chen', 'Bo Waggoner']|['cs.GT']

Under our model, an event occurring with probability $x<1$ is worth strictly less than $x$ times the value of the event when it occurs with certainty. This property can be formalized in the form of an uncertainty weighting function. Our model is a special case of models considered under prospect theory, an alternative to the heavily studied expected utility theory in economics. Our goal is to understand the implications of this kind of attitude towards risk on mechanism design.   We specifically examine three aspects of revenue optimal mechanism design as they relate to risk. First, how does risk aversion affect the use of randomization within mechanism design? Second, in dynamic settings where the buyer's lack of information about future values allows the seller to extract more revenue, how does risk aversion affect the ability of the seller to exploit the uncertainty of future events? Finally, is it possible to obtain approximation guarantees for revenue that are robust to the specific risk model?   We present three main results. First, we characterize optimal mechanisms in the single-shot setting as menus of binary lotteries and show that under extreme risk aversion, for any value distribution, almost the entire social welfare can be extracted as revenue. Second, we show that under a reasonable bounded-risk-aversion assumption, posted pricing obtains a constant risk-robust approximation to the optimal revenue. Third, in contrast to this positive result, we show that in dynamic settings it is not possible to achieve any constant factor approximation to revenue in a risk-robust manner.|studi model risk agent undervalu uncertain outcom model event occur probabl worth strict less time valu event occur certainti properti formal form uncertainti weight function model special case model consid prospect theori altern heavili studi expect util theori econom goal understand implic kind attitud toward risk mechan design specif examin three aspect revenu optim mechan design relat risk first doe risk avers affect use random within mechan design second dynam set buyer lack inform futur valu allow seller extract revenu doe risk avers affect abil seller exploit uncertainti futur event final possibl obtain approxim guarante revenu robust specif risk model present three main result first character optim mechan singl shot set menus binari lotteri show extrem risk avers ani valu distribut almost entir social welfar extract revenu second show reason bound risk avers assumpt post price obtain constant risk robust approxim optim revenu third contrast posit result show dynam set possibl achiev ani constant factor approxim revenu risk robust manner|['Shuchi Chawla', 'Kira Goldner', 'J.

Players are only able to choose their decisions from a feasible action set. The feasible set is considered to be a private linear equality constraint that is coupled through decisions of the other players. We consider that each player has his own private constraint and it has not to be shared with the other players. This general case also embodies the one with shared constraints between players and it can be also simply extended to the case with inequality constraints. Since the players don't have access to other players' actions, they need to exchange estimates of others' actions and a local copy of the Lagrangian multiplier with their neighbors over a connected communication graph. We develop a relatively fast algorithm by reformulating the conservative GNE problem within the framework of inexact-ADMM. The convergence of the algorithm is guaranteed under a few mild assumptions on cost functions. Finally, the algorithm is simulated for a wireless ad-hoc network.|paper problem find general nash equilibrium gne network game studi player onli abl choos decis feasibl action set feasibl set consid privat linear equal constraint coupl decis player consid player privat constraint share player general case also embodi one share constraint player also simpli extend case inequ constraint sinc player access player action need exchang estim action local copi lagrangian multipli neighbor connect communic graph develop relat fast algorithm reformul conserv gne problem within framework inexact admm converg algorithm guarante mild assumpt cost function final algorithm simul wireless ad hoc network|['Farzad Salehisadaghiani', 'Lacra Pavel']|['cs.GT', 'cs.SY']

Instead of classical game theory we use evolutionary game theory to analyse the reputation based resource sharing in peer to peer system. Classical game-theoretical approach requires global information of the population. However, the evolutionary games only assumes light cognitive capabilities of users, that is, each user imitates the behavior of other user with better payoff. We find that without any extra benefit reputation strategy is not stable in the system. We also find the fraction of users who calculate the reputation for controlling the free riding in equilibrium. In this work first we made a game theoretical model for the reputation system and then we calculate the threshold of the fraction of users with which the reputation strategy is sustainable in the system.

Given the critical role of ICs in the control and operation of vehicular systems and other modern engineering designs, such offshore outsourcing has led to serious security threats due to the potential of insertion of hardware trojans - malicious designs that, when activated, can lead to highly detrimental consequences. In this paper, a novel game-theoretic framework is proposed to analyze the interactions between a hardware manufacturer, acting as attacker, and an IC testing facility, acting as defender. The problem is formulated as a noncooperative game in which the attacker must decide on the type of trojan that it inserts while taking into account the detection penalty as well as the damage caused by the trojan. Meanwhile, the resource-constrained defender must decide on the best testing strategy that allows optimizing its overall utility which accounts for both damages and the fines. The proposed game is based on the robust behavioral framework of prospect theory (PT) which allows capturing the potential uncertainty, risk, and irrational behavior in the decision making of both the attacker and defender. For both, the standard rational expected utility (EUT) case and the PT case, a novel algorithm based on fictitious play is proposed and shown to converge to a mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium. For an illustrative case study, thorough analytical results are derived for both EUT and PT to study the properties of the reached equilibrium as well as the impact of key system parameters such as the defender-set fine. Simulation results assess the performance of the proposed framework under both EUT and PT and show that the use of PT will provide invaluable insights on the outcomes of the proposed hardware trojan game, in particular, and system security, in general.|outsourc integr circuit ic manufactur offshor foundri grown exponenti recent year given critic role ic control oper vehicular system modern engin design offshor outsourc led serious secur threat due potenti insert hardwar trojan malici design activ lead high detriment consequ paper novel game theoret framework propos analyz interact hardwar manufactur act attack ic test facil act defend problem formul noncoop game attack must decid type trojan insert take account detect penalti well damag caus trojan meanwhil resourc constrain defend must decid best test strategi allow optim overal util account damag fine propos game base robust behavior framework prospect theori pt allow captur potenti uncertainti risk irrat behavior decis make attack defend standard ration expect util eut case pt case novel algorithm base fictiti play propos shown converg mix strategi nash equilibrium illustr case studi thorough analyt result deriv eut pt studi properti reach equilibrium well impact key system paramet defend set fine simul result assess perform propos framework eut pt show use pt provid invalu insight outcom propos hardwar trojan game particular system secur general|['Walid Saad', 'Anibal Sanjab', 'Yunpeng Wang', 'Charles Kamhoua', 'Kevin Kwiat']|['cs.IT', 'cs.CR', 'cs.GT', 'math.IT']

We propose a distributed energy efficient power control algorithm which allows each user in the two-tier network taking individual decisions to optimize its own energy efficiency (EE) for the multi-user and multi-cell scenario. The distributed power control algorithm is implemented by decoupling the EE optimization problem into two steps. In the first step, we propose to assign the users on the same resource into the same group and each group can optimize its own EE, respectively. In the second step, multiple power control games based on evolutionary game theory (EGT) are formulated for each group, which allows each user optimizing its own EE. In the EGT-based power control games, each player selects a strategy giving a higher payoff than the average payoff, which can improve the fairness among the users. The proposed algorithm has a linear complexity with respect to the number of subcarriers and the number of cells in comparison with the brute force approach which has an exponential complexity.

We consider a decision-maker who sequentially samples from a finite set of Gaussian signals, and wants to predict a persistent multi-dimensional state at an unknown final period. What signal should he choose to observe in each period? Related problems about optimal experimentation and dynamic learning tend to have solutions that can only be approximated or implicitly characterized. In contrast, we find that in our problem, the dynamically optimal path of signal acquisitions generically: (1) eventually coincides at every period with the myopic path of signal acquisitions, and (2) eventually achieves ""total optimality,"" so that at every large period, the decision-maker will not want to revise his previous signal acquisitions, even if given this opportunity. In special classes of environments that we describe, these properties attain not only eventually, but from period 1. Finally, we characterize the asymptotic frequency with which each signal is chosen, and how this depends on primitives of the informational environment."|decis maker often learn acquir inform distinct sourc possibl provid complementari inform consid decis maker sequenti sampl finit set gaussian signal want predict persist multi dimension state unknown final period signal choos observ period relat problem optim experiment dynam learn tend solut onli approxim implicit character contrast find problem dynam optim path signal acquisit generic eventu coincid everi period myopic path signal acquisit eventu achiev total optim everi larg period decis maker want revis previous signal acquisit even given opportun special class environ describ properti attain onli eventu period final character asymptot frequenc signal chosen depend primit inform environ|['Annie Liang', 'Xiaosheng Mu', 'Vasilis Syrgkanis']|['cs.GT', 'cs.LG', 'math.ST', 'stat.TH']

To handle spatially uneven computation workloads in the network, cooperation among SBSs via workload peer offloading is essential to avoid large computation latency at overloaded SBSs and provide high quality of service to end users. However, performing effective peer offloading faces many unique challenges in small cell networks due to limited energy resources committed by self-interested SBS owners, uncertainties in the system dynamics and co-provisioning of radio access and computing services. This paper develops a novel online SBS peer offloading framework, called OPEN, by leveraging the Lyapunov technique, in order to maximize the long-term system performance while keeping the energy consumption of SBSs below individual long-term constraints. OPEN works online without requiring information about future system dynamics, yet provides provably near-optimal performance compared to the oracle solution that has the complete future information. In addition, this paper formulates a novel peer offloading game among SBSs, analyzes its equilibrium and efficiency loss in terms of the price of anarchy in order to thoroughly understand SBSs' strategic behaviors, thereby enabling decentralized and autonomous peer offloading decision making. Extensive simulations are carried out and show that peer offloading among SBSs dramatically improves the edge computing performance.|ultra dens deploy small cell base station sbss endow cloud like comput function pave way pervas mobil edg comput mec enabl ultra low latenc locat awar varieti emerg mobil applic internet thing handl spatial uneven comput workload network cooper among sbss via workload peer offload essenti avoid larg comput latenc overload sbss provid high qualiti servic end user howev perform effect peer offload face mani uniqu challeng small cell network due limit energi resourc commit self interest sbs owner uncertainti system dynam co provis radio access comput servic paper develop novel onlin sbs peer offload framework call open leverag lyapunov techniqu order maxim long term system perform keep energi consumpt sbss individu long term constraint open work onlin without requir inform futur system dynam yet provid provabl near optim perform compar oracl solut complet futur inform addit paper formul novel peer offload game among sbss analyz equilibrium effici loss term price anarchi order thorough understand sbss strateg behavior therebi enabl decentr autonom peer offload decis make extens simul carri show peer offload among sbss dramat improv edg comput perform|['Lixing Chen', 'Sheng Zhou', 'Jie Xu']|['cs.GT', 'cs.DC']

To enable this, in future IoT networks, besides the conventional data access points (DAPs) responsible for collecting data from IoT devices, energy access points (EAPs) should be deployed to transfer radio frequency (RF) energy to IoT devices to maintain their sustainable operations. In practice, the DAPs and EAPs may be operated by different operators and a DAP should provide certain incentives to motivate the surrounding EAPs to charge its associated IoT device(s) to assist its data collection. Motivated by this, in this paper we develop a contract theory-based incentive mechanism for the energy trading in RFEH assisted IoT systems. The necessary and sufficient condition for the feasibility of the formulated contract is analyzed. The optimal contract is derived to maximize the DAP's expected utility as well as the social welfare.

In the considered game, not only each player's local objective function depends on other players' decisions, but also the feasible decision sets of all the players are coupled together with a globally shared affine inequality constraint. Adopting the variational GNE, that is the solution of a variational inequality, as a refinement of GNE, we introduce a primal-dual algorithm that players can use to seek it in a distributed manner. Each player only needs to know its local objective function, local feasible set, and a local block of the affine constraint. Meanwhile, each player only needs to observe the decisions on which its local objective function explicitly depends through the interference graph and share information related to multipliers with its neighbors through a multiplier graph. Through a primal-dual analysis and an augmentation of variables, we reformulate the problem as finding the zeros of a sum of monotone operators. Our distributed primal-dual algorithm is based on forward-backward operator splitting methods. We prove its convergence to the variational GNE for fixed step-sizes under some mild assumptions. Then a distributed algorithm with inertia is also introduced and analyzed for variational GNE seeking.

Specifically, given a voting rule, we wish to design a weighting scheme such that applying the voting rule, with voters weighted by the scheme, leads to choices that are almost as good as those endorsed by the best voter in hindsight. We derive possibility and impossibility results for the existence of such weighting schemes, depending on whether the voting rule and the weighting scheme are deterministic or randomized, as well as on the social choice axioms satisfied by the voting rule.|vote system typic treat voter equal argu perhap voter support good choic past given higher weight voter support bad one develop formal framework desir weight scheme draw regret learn specif given vote rule wish design weight scheme appli vote rule voter weight scheme lead choic almost good endors best voter hindsight deriv possibl imposs result exist weight scheme depend whether vote rule weight scheme determinist random well social choic axiom satisfi vote rule|['Nika Haghtalab', 'Ritesh Noothigattu', 'Ariel D.

For two-sided matching, the Gale-Shapley algorithm; for one-sided matching, (random) Serial Dictatorship and Probabilistic Serial rule; for school choice, Gale-Shapley and the Boston mechanisms.   The main reason for the dominance of these algorithms is their good (worst-case) axiomatic behaviour with respect to notions of efficiency and strategyproofness. However if we shift the focus to fairness, social welfare, tradeoffs between incompatible axioms, and average-case analysis, it is far from clear that these algorithms are optimal.   We investigate new algorithms several of which have not appeared (to our knowledge) in the literature before. We give a unified presentation in which algorithms for 2-sided matching yield 1-sided matching algorithms in a systematic way. In addition to axiomatic properties, we investigate agent welfare using both theoretical and computational approaches. We find that some of the new algorithms are worthy of consideration for certain applications.

Unlike prior results, our reduction achieves exact incentive compatibility for problems with multi-dimensional and continuous type spaces. The key technical barrier preventing exact incentive compatibility in prior black-box reductions is that repairing violations of incentive constraints requires understanding the distribution of the mechanism's output. Reductions that instead estimate the output distribution by sampling inevitably suffer from sampling error, which typically precludes exact incentive compatibility.   We overcome this barrier by employing and generalizing the computational model in the literature on Bernoulli Factories. In a Bernoulli factory problem, one is given a function mapping the bias of an ""input coin"" to that of an ""output coin"", and the challenge is to efficiently simulate the output coin given sample access to the input coin. We generalize this to the ""expectations from samples"" computational model, in which an instance is specified by a function mapping the expected values of a set of input distributions to a distribution over outcomes. The challenge is to give a polynomial time algorithm that exactly samples from the distribution over outcomes given only sample access to the input distributions. In this model, we give a polynomial time algorithm for the exponential weights: expected values of the input distributions correspond to the weights of alternatives and we wish to select an alternative with probability proportional to an exponential function of its weight. This algorithm is the key ingredient in designing an incentive compatible mechanism for bipartite matching, which can be used to make the approximately incentive compatible reduction of Hartline et al.

Such correlation is a crucial concern, especially in spatio-temporal domains like conservation area patrolling, where attackers can monitor patrollers at certain areas and then infer their patrolling routes using such correlation. To mitigate this issue, we introduce the principle of max-entropy to security games, and focus on designing entropy-maximizing defending strategies for the spatio-temporal security game -- a major victim of CoC. We prove that the problem is #P-hard in general, but propose efficient algorithms in well-motivated special settings.

We formulate an optimization problem consisting in maximizing the opinion of the whole network when controlling an external influence able to affect each node individually. We find a mathematical closed form of this problem, and use its solution to derive our centrality measure. According to the opinion centrality, the more a node is worth investing external influence, and the more it is central. We perform an empirical study of the proposed centrality over a toy network, as well as a collection of real-world networks.

That the lakes are rectifiable means that their boundaries are finitely long. This requirement is to avoid pathological examples where the man survives forever because any path to the lions is infinitely long. We show that the answer to the question is not always ""yes"" by giving an example of a region $R$ in the plane where the man has a strategy to survive forever. $R$ is a polygonal region with holes and the exterior and interior boundaries are pairwise disjoint, simple polygons. Our construction is the first truly two-dimensional example where the man can survive.

We analyze an online problem in which the algorithm is not given the set of bidders in advance. Instead, the bidders are revealed sequentially in a uniformly random order, similarly to secretary problems. The algorithm must make an irrevocable decision about which items to allocate to the current bidder before the next one is revealed.

Previous work by Balcan et al. in this setting showed how to compute cost shares that satisfy the core property with high probability for limited classes of functions. We expand on their work and give an algorithm that computes such cost shares for any function with a non-empty core.

We first show that when cost functions come from the family of submodular functions with bounded curvature, $\kappa$, the Shapley value can be approximated from samples up to a $\sqrt{1 - \kappa}$ factor, and that the bound is tight. We then define statistical analogues of the Shapley axioms, and derive a notion of statistical Shapley value. We show that these can always be approximated arbitrarily well for general functions over any distribution $\mathcal{D}$.|studi cost share problem cooper game situat cost function avail via oracl queri must instead deriv data repres tupl differ subset player formal approach call statist cost share consid comput core shapley valu tupl drawn distribut mathcal previous work balcan et al set show comput cost share satisfi core properti high probabl limit class function expand work give algorithm comput cost share ani function non empti core complement result prove inapproxim lower bound weaker relax turn attent shapley valu first show cost function come famili submodular function bound curvatur kappa shapley valu approxim sampl sqrt kappa factor bound tight defin statist analogu shapley axiom deriv notion statist shapley valu show alway approxim arbitrarili well general function ani distribut mathcal|['Eric Balkanski', 'Umar Syed', 'Sergei Vassilvitskii']|['cs.GT', 'cs.LG']

The types of players are independently chosen according to the initial probabilities, and are kept the same all through the game. At every stage, players simultaneously choose actions, and announce their actions publicly. For finite horizon cases, an explicit linear program is provided to compute players' security strategies.

This paper considers the case of nested information in repeated zero-sum games and studies the computation of strategies for both the informed and uninformed players for finite-horizon and discounted infinite-horizon nested information games. For finite-horizon settings, we exploit that for both players, the security strategy, i.e. Nash equilibrium, and also the opponent's corresponding best response depend only on the informed player's history of actions. Using this property, we refine the sequence form, and formulate an LP computation of player strategies that is linear in the size of the uninformed player's action set. For the infinite-horizon discounted game, we construct LP formulations to compute the approximated security strategies for both players, and provide a bound on the performance difference between the suboptimal strategies and the security strategies.

Our fairness guarantees are in terms of the maximin share, that is defined to be the maximum value that an agent can ensure for herself, if she were to partition the goods into $n$ bundles, and then receive a minimum valued bundle. Since maximin fair allocations (i.e., allocations in which each agent gets at least her maximin share) do not always exist, prior work has focussed on approximation results that aim to find allocations in which the value of the bundle allocated to each agent is (multiplicatively) as close to her maximin share as possible. In particular, Procaccia and Wang (2014) along with Amanatidis et al. (2015) have shown that under a $2/3$-approximate maximin fair allocation always exists and can be found in polynomial time. We complement these results by developing a simple and efficient algorithm that achieves the same approximation guarantee.   Furthermore, we initiate the study of approximate maximin fair division under submodular valuations. Specifically, we show that when the valuations of the agents are nonnegative, monotone, and submodular, then a $1/10$-approximate maximin fair allocation is guaranteed to exist. In fact, we show that such an allocation (with a slightly worse approximation guarantee) can be efficiently found by a simple round-robin algorithm. A technical contribution of the paper is to analyze the performance of this combinatorial algorithm by employing the concept of multilinear extensions.|consid problem divid indivis good fair among agent addit submodular valuat good fair guarante term maximin share defin maximum valu agent ensur partit good bundl receiv minimum valu bundl sinc maximin fair alloc alloc agent get least maximin share alway exist prior work focuss approxim result aim find alloc valu bundl alloc agent multipl close maximin share possibl particular procaccia wang along amanatidi et al shown approxim maximin fair alloc alway exist found polynomi time complement result develop simpl effici algorithm achiev approxim guarante furthermor initi studi approxim maximin fair divis submodular valuat specif show valuat agent nonneg monoton submodular approxim maximin fair alloc guarante exist fact show alloc slight wors approxim guarante effici found simpl round robin algorithm technic contribut paper analyz perform combinatori algorithm employ concept multilinear extens|['Siddharth Barman', 'Sanath Kumar Krishna Murthy']|['cs.GT']

Fair allocation has been the subject of many studies in both divisible and indivisible settings. Our emphasis is on the case where the goods are indivisible and agents have unequal entitlements. This problem is a generalization of the work by Procaccia and Wang wherein the agents are assumed to be symmetric with respect to their entitlements. Although Procaccia and Wang show an almost fair (constant approximation) allocation exists in their setting, our main result is in sharp contrast to their observation. We show that, in some cases with $n$ agents, no allocation can guarantee better than $1/n$ approximation of a fair allocation when the entitlements are not necessarily equal. Furthermore, we devise a simple algorithm that ensures a $1/n$ approximation guarantee. Our second result is for a restricted version of the problem where the valuation of every agent for each good is bounded by the total value he wishes to receive in a fair allocation. Although this assumption might seem w.l.o.g, we show it enables us to find a $1/2$ approximation fair allocation via a greedy algorithm. Finally, we run some experiments on real-world data and show that, in practice, a fair allocation is likely to exist.

We focus on a semantically rich dataset from Singapore's National Science Experiment that captures detailed information about the daily behavior of thousands of Singaporean students. Using this dataset, we can identify the routes as well as the modes of transportation used by the students, e.g. car (driving or being driven to school) versus bus or metro, estimate source and sink destinations (home-school) and trip duration, as well as their mode-dependent available routes. We quantify both the system and individual optimality. Our estimate of the Empirical Price of Anarchy lies between 1.11 and 1.22.

We formulate the power control problem in self-organizing small cell networks as a non-cooperative game, and propose a distributed energy efficient power control scheme, which allows the small base stations (SBSs) to take individual decisions for attaining the Nash equilibrium (NE) with minimum information exchange. Specially, in the non-cooperative power control game, a non-convex optimization problem is formulated for each SBS to maximize their energy efficiency (EE). By exploiting the properties of parameter-free fractional programming and the concept of perspective function, the non-convex optimization problem for each SBS is transformed into an equivalent constrained convex optimization problem. Then, the constrained convex optimization problem is converted into an unconstrained convex optimization problem by exploiting the mixed penalty function method. The inequality constraints are eliminated by introducing the logarithmic barrier functions and the equality constraint is eliminated by introducing the quadratic penalty function. We also theoretically show the existence and the uniqueness of the NE in the non-cooperative power control game.

Making use of a population game model and the well-known Chung-Lu random graph model, we study how one could encourage selfish agents to invest more in security by internalizing the externalities produced by their security investments.   To this end, we first establish an interesting relation between the local minimizers of social cost and the Nash equilibria of a population game with slightly altered costs. Secondly, under a mild technical assumption, we demonstrate that there exists a unique minimizer of social cost and it coincides with the unique Nash equilibrium of the population game. This finding tells us how to modify the private cost functions of selfish agents in order to enhance the overall security and reduce social cost. In addition, it reveals how the sensitivity of overall security to security investments of agents influences their externalities and, consequently, penalties or taxes that should be imposed for internalization of externalities. Finally, we illustrate how the degree distribution of agents influences their security investments and overall security at both the NEs of population games and social optima.|increas connect among compris agent sub system larg complex system grow interest understand interdepend secur deal ineffici secur invest make use popul game model well known chung lu random graph model studi one could encourag selfish agent invest secur intern extern produc secur invest end first establish interest relat local minim social cost nash equilibria popul game slight alter cost second mild technic assumpt demonstr exist uniqu minim social cost coincid uniqu nash equilibrium popul game find tell us modifi privat cost function selfish agent order enhanc overal secur reduc social cost addit reveal sensit overal secur secur invest agent influenc extern consequ penalti tax impos intern extern final illustr degre distribut agent influenc secur invest overal secur nes popul game social optima|['Richard J.

Recently, Igarashi et al. have initiated the study of group activity selection problems on social networks (gGASP): a group of players can engage in the same activity if the members of the group form a connected subset of the underlying communication structure. Igarashi et al. have primarily focused on Nash stable outcomes, and showed that many associated algorithmic questions are computationally hard even for very simple networks. In this paper we study the parameterized complexity of gGASP with respect to the number of activities as well as with respect to the number of players, for several solution concepts such as Nash stability, individual stability and core stability. The first parameter we consider in the number of activities. For this parameter, we propose an FPT algorithm for Nash stability for the case where the social network is acyclic and obtain a W[1]-hardness result for cliques (i.e., for classic GASP); similar results hold for individual stability. In contrast, finding a core stable outcome is hard even if the number of activities is bounded by a small constant, both for classic GASP and when the social network is a star. Another parameter we study is the number of players. While all solution concepts we consider become polynomial-time computable when this parameter is bounded by a constant, we prove W[1]-hardness results for cliques (i.e., for classic GASP).|group activ select problem gasp player form coalit particip activ prefer pair form activ group size recent igarashi et al initi studi group activ select problem social network ggasp group player engag activ member group form connect subset communic structur igarashi et al primarili focus nash stabl outcom show mani associ algorithm question comput hard even veri simpl network paper studi parameter complex ggasp respect number activ well respect number player sever solut concept nash stabil individu stabil core stabil first paramet consid number activ paramet propos fpt algorithm nash stabil case social network acycl obtain hard result cliqu classic gasp similar result hold individu stabil contrast find core stabl outcom hard even number activ bound small constant classic gasp social network star anoth paramet studi number player solut concept consid becom polynomi time comput paramet bound constant prove hard result cliqu classic gasp|['Ayumi Igarashi', 'Robert Bredereck', 'Edith Elkind']|['cs.GT']

Demand Response providers bid reduction capacity into the wholesale electricity market by asking their customers under contract to temporarily reduce their consumption in exchange for a monetary incentive. To contribute to the analysis of consumer behavior in response to such incentives, this paper formulates Demand Response as a Mechanism Design problem, where a Demand Response Provider elicits private information of its rational, profit-maximizing customers who derive positive expected utility by participating in reduction events. By designing an incentive compatible and individually rational mechanism to collect users' price elasticities of demand, the Demand Response provider can target the most susceptible users to incentives. We measure reductions by comparing the materialized consumption to the projected consumption, which we model as the ""10-in-10""-baseline, the regulatory standard set by the California Independent System Operator. Due to the suboptimal performance of this baseline, we show, using consumption data of residential customers in California, that Demand Response Providers receive payments for ""virtual reductions"", which exist due to the inaccuracies of the baseline rather than actual reductions. Improving the accuracy of the baseline diminishes the contribution of these virtual reductions."|residenti demand respons emerg viabl tool allevi suppli demand imbal electr particular dure time electr grid strain due shortag suppli demand respons provid bid reduct capac wholesal electr market ask custom contract temporarili reduc consumpt exchang monetari incent contribut analysi consum behavior respons incent paper formul demand respons mechan design problem demand respons provid elicit privat inform ration profit maxim custom deriv posit expect util particip reduct event design incent compat individu ration mechan collect user price elast demand demand respons provid target suscept user incent measur reduct compar materi consumpt project consumpt model baselin regulatori standard set california independ system oper due suboptim perform baselin show use consumpt data residenti custom california demand respons provid receiv payment virtual reduct exist due inaccuraci baselin rather actual reduct improv accuraci baselin diminish contribut virtual reduct|['Datong P.

It is a major open problem whether parity games with perfect information can be solved in PTIME. Restricting the structural complexity of the game arenas, however, often leads to efficient algorithms for parity games. Such results are known for graph classes of bounded tree-width, DAG-width, directed path-width, and entanglement, which we describe in terms of cops and robber games. Conversely, the introduction of imperfect information makes the problem more difficult, it becomes EXPTIME-hard. We analyse the interaction of both approaches.   We use a simple method to measure the amount of ""unawareness""' of a player, the amount of imperfect information. It turns out that if it is unbounded, low structural complexity does not make the problem simpler. It remains EXPTIME-hard or PSPACE-hard even on very simple graphs.   For games with bounded imperfect information we analyse the powerset construction, which is commonly used to convert a game of imperfect information into an equivalent game with perfect information. This construction preserves boundedness of directed path-width and DAG-width, but not of entanglement or of tree-width. Hence, if directed path-width or DAG-width are bounded, parity games with bounded imperfect information can be solved in PTIME. For DAG-width we follow two approaches. One leads to a generalization of the known fact that perfect information parity games are in PTIME if DAG-width is bounded. We prove this theorem for non-monotone DAG-width.

This happens because the existing mechanisms consider the worst case scenario where the means of the agents' stochastic rewards are separated by a very small amount that depends on $T$. We make, and, exploit the crucial observation that in most scenarios, the separation between the agents' rewards is rarely a function of $T$. Moreover, in the case that the rewards of the arms are arbitrarily close, the regret contributed by such sub-optimal arms is minimal. Our idea is to allow the center to indicate the resolution, $\Delta$, with which the agents must be distinguished. This immediately leads us to introduce the notion of $\Delta$-Regret. Using sponsored search auctions as a concrete example (the same idea applies for other applications as well), we propose a dominant strategy incentive compatible (DSIC) and individually rational (IR), deterministic MAB mechanism, based on ideas from the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) family of MAB algorithms. Remarkably, the proposed mechanism $\Delta$-UCB achieves a $\Delta$-regret of $O(\log T)$ for the case of sponsored search auctions.

Selfish clients submit jobs, each with an arrival time, deadline, length, and value. The service provider's goal is to implement a truthful online mechanism for scheduling jobs so as to maximize the social welfare of the schedule. Recent work shows that under a stochastic assumption on job arrivals, there is a single-parameter family of mechanisms that achieves near-optimal social welfare. We show that given any such family of near-optimal online mechanisms, there exists an online mechanism that in the worst case performs nearly as well as the best of the given mechanisms. Our mechanism is truthful whenever the mechanisms in the given family are truthful and prompt, and achieves optimal (within constant factors) regret.   We model the problem of competing against a family of online scheduling mechanisms as one of learning from expert advice. A primary challenge is that any scheduling decisions we make affect not only the payoff at the current step, but also the resource availability and payoffs in future steps. Furthermore, switching from one algorithm (a.k.a. expert) to another in an online fashion is challenging both because it requires synchronization with the state of the latter algorithm as well as because it affects the incentive structure of the algorithms. We further show how to adapt our algorithm to a non-clairvoyant setting where job lengths are unknown until jobs are run to completion. Once again, in this setting, we obtain truthfulness along with asymptotically optimal regret (within poly-logarithmic factors).|consid schedul problem cloud servic provid multipl unit resourc avail time selfish client submit job arriv time deadlin length valu servic provid goal implement truth onlin mechan schedul job maxim social welfar schedul recent work show stochast assumpt job arriv singl paramet famili mechan achiev near optim social welfar show given ani famili near optim onlin mechan exist onlin mechan worst case perform near well best given mechan mechan truth whenev mechan given famili truth prompt achiev optim within constant factor regret model problem compet famili onlin schedul mechan one learn expert advic primari challeng ani schedul decis make affect onli payoff current step also resourc avail payoff futur step furthermor switch one algorithm expert anoth onlin fashion challeng becaus requir synchron state latter algorithm well becaus affect incent structur algorithm show adapt algorithm non clairvoy set job length unknown job run complet onc set obtain truth along asymptot optim regret within poli logarithm factor|['Shuchi Chawla', 'Nikhil Devanur', 'Janardhan Kulkarni', 'Rad Niazadeh']|['cs.GT', 'cs.AI', 'cs.DS', 'cs.LG']

Two widely-studied randomized mechanisms in multiagent settings are the Random Serial Dictatorship (RSD) and the Probabilistic Serial Rule (PS). Both mechanisms require only that agents specify ordinal preferences and have a number of desirable economic and computational properties. However, the induced outcomes of the mechanisms are often incomparable and thus there are challenges when it comes to deciding which mechanism to adopt in practice. In this paper, we first consider the space of general ordinal preferences and provide empirical results on the (in)comparability of RSD and PS. We analyze their respective economic properties under general and lexicographic preferences. We then instantiate utility functions with the goal of gaining insights on the manipulability, efficiency, and envyfreeness of the mechanisms under different risk-attitude models. Our results hold under various preference distribution models, which further confirm the broad use of RSD in most practical applications.|one side match mechan fundament assign set indivis object set self interest agent monetari transfer allow two wide studi random mechan multiag set random serial dictatorship rsd probabilist serial rule ps mechan requir onli agent specifi ordin prefer number desir econom comput properti howev induc outcom mechan often incompar thus challeng come decid mechan adopt practic paper first consid space general ordin prefer provid empir result compar rsd ps analyz respect econom properti general lexicograph prefer instanti util function goal gain insight manipul effici envyfre mechan differ risk attitud model result hold various prefer distribut model confirm broad use rsd practic applic|['Hadi Hosseini', 'Kate Larson', 'Robin Cohen']|['cs.GT', 'cs.AI', 'cs.MA', 'I.2.11; J.4']

However, previously proposed network selection schemes mainly focused on offloading as much data traffic to Wi-Fi as possible, without systematically considering the Wi-Fi network congestion and the ping-pong effect, both of which may lead to a poor overall user quality of experience. Thus, in this paper, we study a more practical network selection problem by considering both the impacts of the network congestion and switching penalties. More specifically, we formulate the users' interactions as a Bayesian network selection game (NSG) under the incomplete information of the users' mobilities. We prove that it is a Bayesian potential game and show the existence of a pure Bayesian Nash equilibrium that can be easily reached. We then propose a distributed network selection (DNS) algorithm based on the network congestion statistics obtained from the operator. Furthermore, we show that computing the optimal centralized network allocation is an NP-hard problem, which further justifies our distributed approach. Simulation results show that the DNS algorithm achieves the highest user utility and a good fairness among users, as compared with the on-the-spot offloading and cellular-only benchmark schemes.|intellig network select play import role achiev effect data offload integr cellular wi fi network howev previous propos network select scheme main focus offload much data traffic wi fi possibl without systemat consid wi fi network congest ping pong effect may lead poor overal user qualiti experi thus paper studi practic network select problem consid impact network congest switch penalti specif formul user interact bayesian network select game nsg incomplet inform user mobil prove bayesian potenti game show exist pure bayesian nash equilibrium easili reach propos distribut network select dns algorithm base network congest statist obtain oper furthermor show comput optim central network alloc np hard problem justifi distribut approach simul result show dns algorithm achiev highest user util good fair among user compar spot offload cellular onli benchmark scheme|['Man Hon Cheung', 'Fen Hou', 'Jianwei Huang', 'Richard Southwell']|['cs.NI', 'cs.GT']

In this paper we study multi-item lowest unique bid auctions (LUBA) with resubmission in discrete bid spaces under budget constraints. We show that the game does not have pure Bayes-Nash equilibria (except in very special cases). However, at least one mixed Bayes-Nash equilibria exists for arbitrary number of bidders and items. The equilibrium is explicitly computed for two-bidder setup with resubmission possibilities. In the general setting we propose a distributed strategic learning algorithm to approximate equilibria. Computer simulations indicate that the error quickly decays in few number of steps. When the number of bidders per item follows a Poisson distribution, it is shown that the seller can get a non-negligible revenue on several items, and hence making a partial revelation of the true value of the items. Finally, the attitude of the bidders towards the risk is considered.

As a model, we consider competition between two multi-armed bandit algorithms faced with the same bandit instance. Users arrive one by one and choose among the two algorithms, so that each algorithm makes progress if and only if it is chosen.

For this class of dynamics, convergence to pure Nash equilibria has been demonstrated only for the fine class of potential games. Prior work primarily provides convergence properties of the dynamics through stochastic approximations, where the asymptotic behavior can be associated with the limit points of an ordinary-differential equation (ODE). However, analyzing global convergence through the ODE-approximation requires the existence of a Lyapunov or a potential function, which naturally restricts the applicabity of these algorithms to a fine class of games.

In this work, we propose a hybrid fairness rule that balances a strict lexicographic preference ordering over classes of agents and a utilitarian objective that maximizes economic efficiency. We develop a utility function that favors disadvantaged groups lexicographically; but if cost to overall efficiency becomes too high, it smoothly switches to a utilitarian objective. This rule has only one parameter which is proportional to a bound on the price of fairness, and can be adjusted by policymakers.

By extending them to controlled operations, we define a quantum controlled Cop and Robber game, which expands the classical Cop and Robber game, as well as classically controlled quantum Cop and Robber game. In contrast to the typical scheme for introducing quantum games, we assume that both parties can utilise full information about the opponent's strategy. We show that the utilisation of the full knowledge about the opponent's state does not provide the advantage. Moreover, the chances of catching the Robber decreases for classically cop-win graphs. The result does not depend on the chosen model of evolution. On the other hand, the possibility to execute controlled quantum operations allows catching the Robber on almost all classically cop-win graphs.

We consider cost-function-based prediction markets in which an automated market maker adjusts security prices according to the history of trade. We decompose the forecasting error into four components: \emph{sampling error}, occurring because traders only possess noisy estimates of ground truth; \emph{risk-aversion effect}, arising because traders reveal beliefs only through self-interested trade; \emph{market-maker bias}, resulting from the use of a particular market maker (i.e., cost function) to facilitate trade; and finally, \emph{convergence error}, arising because, at any point in time, market prices may still be in flux. Our goal is to understand the tradeoffs between these error components, and how they are influenced by design decisions such as the functional form of the cost function and the amount of liquidity in the market. We specifically consider a model in which traders have exponential utility and exponential-family beliefs drawn with an independent noise relative to ground truth. In this setting, sampling error and risk-aversion effect vanish as the number of traders grows, but there is a tradeoff between the other two components: decreasing the market maker's liquidity results in smaller market-maker bias, but may also slow down convergence. We provide both upper and lower bounds on market-maker bias and convergence error, and demonstrate via numerical simulations that these bounds are tight. Our results yield new insights into the question of how to set the market's liquidity parameter, and into the extent to which markets that enforce coherent prices across securities produce better predictions than markets that price securities independently.|introduc analyz sourc error predict market forecast order character bound differ secur price ground truth valu consid cost function base predict market autom market maker adjust secur price accord histori trade decompos forecast error four compon emph sampl error occur becaus trader onli possess noisi estim ground truth emph risk avers effect aris becaus trader reveal belief onli self interest trade emph market maker bias result use particular market maker cost function facilit trade final emph converg error aris becaus ani point time market price may still flux goal understand tradeoff error compon influenc design decis function form cost function amount liquid market specif consid model trader exponenti util exponenti famili belief drawn independ nois relat ground truth set sampl error risk avers effect vanish number trader grow tradeoff two compon decreas market maker liquid result smaller market maker bias may also slow converg provid upper lower bound market maker bias converg error demonstr via numer simul bound tight result yield new insight question set market liquid paramet extent market enforc coher price across secur produc better predict market price secur independ|['Miroslav Dudík', 'Sébastien Lahaie', 'Ryan Rogers', 'Jennifer Wortman Vaughan']|['cs.GT']

That this might be hoped for is based on the common belief that diversity is advantageous in many settings. We investigate this in the context of routing. Our main result is a sharp characterization of the network settings in which diversity always helps, versus those in which it is sometimes harmful.   Specifically, we consider routing games, where diversity arises in the way that users trade-off two criteria (such as time and money, or, in the case of stochastic delays, expectation and variance of delay). We consider both linear and non-linear combinations of the two criteria and view our main contributions as the following: 1) A participant-oriented measure of cost in the presence of user diversity, together with the identification of the natural benchmark: the same cost measure for an appropriately defined average of the diversity. 2) A full characterization of those network topologies for which diversity always helps, for all latency functions and demands. For single-commodity routings, these are series-parallel graphs, while for multi-commodity routings, they are the newly-defined ""block-matching"" networks. The latter comprise a suitable interweaving of multiple series-parallel graphs each connecting a distinct source-sink pair.   While the result for the single-commodity case may seem intuitive in light of the well-known Braess paradox, the two problems are different. But the main technical challenge is to establish the ""only if"" direction of the result for multi-commodity networks. This follows by constructing an instance where diversity hurts, and showing how to embed it in any network which is not block-matching, by carefully exploiting the way the simple source-sink paths of the commodities intersect in the ""non-block-matching"" portion of the network."|seek understand heterogen user prefer yield improv outcom term overal cost might hope base common belief divers advantag mani set investig context rout main result sharp character network set divers alway help versus sometim harm specif consid rout game divers aris way user trade two criteria time money case stochast delay expect varianc delay consid linear non linear combin two criteria view main contribut follow particip orient measur cost presenc user divers togeth identif natur benchmark cost measur appropri defin averag divers full character network topolog divers alway help latenc function demand singl commod rout seri parallel graph multi commod rout newli defin block match network latter compris suitabl interweav multipl seri parallel graph connect distinct sourc sink pair result singl commod case may seem intuit light well known braess paradox two problem differ main technic challeng establish onli direct result multi commod network follow construct instanc divers hurt show emb ani network block match care exploit way simpl sourc sink path commod intersect non block match portion network|['Richard Cole', 'Thanasis Lianeas', 'Evdokia Nikolova']|['cs.GT']

Following a recent model by [B\""artschi et al. 2016], each agent $i$ consumes energy proportional to the distance it travels in the graph, where the different rates of energy consumption are given by weight factors $w_i$. We are interested in optimizing or approximating the total energy consumption over all selected agents.   Unlike previous research, we assume the weights to be private values known only to the respective agents. We present three different mechanisms which select, route and pay the agents in a truthful way that guarantees voluntary participation of the agents, while approximating the optimum energy consumption by a constant factor. To this end we analyze a previous structural result and an approximation algorithm given by [B\""artschi et al. 2017].

Motivated by recent progress in deep learning, we focus on the specific case where agents update their actions according to gradient descent. The first result is that gradient descent converges to a Nash equilibrium in safe games.   The paper provides sufficient conditions that guarantee safe interactions. The main contribution is to define strongly-typed agents and show they are guaranteed to interact safely. A series of examples show that strong-typing generalizes certain key features of convexity and is closely related to blind source separation.

We consider the case where the metric over the actions can be modeled by a complete binary tree, and the distance between two leaves is the size of the subtree of their least common ancestor, which abstracts the case that the actions are points on the continuous interval $[0,1]$ and the switching cost is their distance. In this setting, we give a new algorithm that establishes a regret of $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{kT} + T/k)$, where $k$ is the number of actions and $T$ is the time horizon. When the set of actions corresponds to whole $[0,1]$ interval we can exploit our method for the task of bandit learning with Lipschitz loss functions, where our algorithm achieves an optimal regret rate of $\widetilde{\Theta}(T^{2/3})$, which is the same rate one obtains when there is no penalty for movements. As our main application, we use our new algorithm to solve an adaptive pricing problem. Specifically, we consider the case of a single seller faced with a stream of patient buyers. Each buyer has a private value and a window of time in which they are interested in buying, and they buy at the lowest price in the window, if it is below their value. We show that with an appropriate discretization of the prices, the seller can achieve a regret of $\widetilde{O}(T^{2/3})$ compared to the best fixed price in hindsight, which outperform the previous regret bound of $\widetilde{O}(T^{3/4})$ for the problem.|extend model multi arm bandit unit switch cost incorpor metric action consid case metric action model complet binari tree distanc two leav size subtre least common ancestor abstract case action point continu interv switch cost distanc set give new algorithm establish regret widetild sqrt kt number action time horizon set action correspond whole interv exploit method task bandit learn lipschitz loss function algorithm achiev optim regret rate widetild theta rate one obtain penalti movement main applic use new algorithm solv adapt price problem specif consid case singl seller face stream patient buyer buyer privat valu window time interest buy buy lowest price window valu show appropri discret price seller achiev regret widetild compar best fix price hindsight outperform previous regret bound widetild problem|['Tomer Koren', 'Roi Livni', 'Yishay Mansour']|['cs.LG', 'cs.GT']

In this paper we present Economic Resource Allocation (ERA), a complete framework for scheduling and pricing cloud resources, aimed at increasing the efficiency of cloud resources usage by allocating resources according to economic principles. The ERA architecture carefully abstracts the underlying cloud infrastructure, enabling the development of scheduling and pricing algorithms independently of the concrete lower-level cloud infrastructure and independently of its concerns. Specifically, ERA is designed as a flexible layer that can sit on top of any cloud system and interfaces with both the cloud resource manager and with the users who reserve resources to run their jobs. The jobs are scheduled based on prices that are dynamically calculated according to the predicted demand. Additionally, ERA provides a key internal API to pluggable algorithmic modules that include scheduling, pricing and demand prediction. We provide a proof-of-concept software and demonstrate the effectiveness of the architecture by testing ERA over both public and private cloud systems -- Azure Batch of Microsoft and Hadoop/YARN. A broader intent of our work is to foster collaborations between economics and system communities. To that end, we have developed a simulation platform via which economics and system experts can test their algorithmic implementations.|cloud comput reach signific matur system perspect current deploy solut reli rather basic econom mechan yield suboptim alloc cost hardwar resourc paper present econom resourc alloc era complet framework schedul price cloud resourc aim increas effici cloud resourc usag alloc resourc accord econom principl era architectur care abstract cloud infrastructur enabl develop schedul price algorithm independ concret lower level cloud infrastructur independ concern specif era design flexibl layer sit top ani cloud system interfac cloud resourc manag user reserv resourc run job job schedul base price dynam calcul accord predict demand addit era provid key intern api pluggabl algorithm modul includ schedul price demand predict provid proof concept softwar demonstr effect architectur test era public privat cloud system azur batch microsoft hadoop yarn broader intent work foster collabor econom system communiti end develop simul platform via econom system expert test algorithm implement|['Moshe Babaioff', 'Yishay Mansour', 'Noam Nisan', 'Gali Noti', 'Carlo Curino', 'Nar Ganapathy', 'Ishai Menache', 'Omer Reingold', 'Moshe Tennenholtz', 'Erez Timnat']|['cs.GT', 'cs.DC']

We follow the same modeling approach, focusing on scenarios where the opinion expressed by each user is a compromise between her internal belief and the opinions of a small number of neighbors among her social acquaintances. We formulate simple games that capture this behavior and quantify the inefficiency of equilibria using the well-known notion of the price of anarchy.

We can get the following conclusion: 1) when the government implements the reward-penalty mechanism for carbon emission and recycling simultaneously, the recycling rate as well as the buy-back price offered by the manufacturer are higher than those when the government conducts reward-penalty mechanism exclusively for carbon emission; 2) when the government implements carbon emission constraint, both retailers' selling prices of the new product are higher than those when no carbon emission constraint is forced; 3) there is no certain relationship between the two retailers' selling prices of the new product when the government implements the reward-penalty mechanism only for carbon emission and when it implements the mechanism for carbon emission as well as recycling.|discuss govern reward penalti mechan presenc asymmetr inform carbon emiss constraint downstream retail compet revers suppli chain network consid five game model differ term coordin structur revers suppli chain network power structur reward penalti mechan revers suppli chain network central decis make model revers suppli chain network central decis make model carbon emiss constraint retail competit revers suppli chain network decentr decis make model retail competit revers suppli chain network decentr decis make model carbon emiss constraint retail competit revers suppli chain network decentr decis make model carbon emiss constraint govern reward penalti mechan build particip incent contract model use princip agent theori solv model use lagrang multipli method get follow conclus govern implement reward penalti mechan carbon emiss recycl simultan recycl rate well buy back price offer manufactur higher govern conduct reward penalti mechan exclus carbon emiss govern implement carbon emiss constraint retail sell price new product higher carbon emiss constraint forc certain relationship two retail sell price new product govern implement reward penalti mechan onli carbon emiss implement mechan carbon emiss well recycl|['Xiao-qing Zhang', 'Xi-gang Yuan']|['math.OC', 'cs.GT']

However, to reap the benefits of LTE-U, a fair coexistence mechanism with other incumbent WiFi deployments is required. In this paper, a novel deep learning approach is proposed for modeling the resource allocation problem of LTE-U small base stations (SBSs). The proposed approach enables multiple SBSs to proactively perform dynamic channel selection, carrier aggregation, and fractional spectrum access while guaranteeing fairness with existing WiFi networks and other LTE-U operators. Adopting a proactive coexistence mechanism enables future delay-intolerant LTE-U data demands to be served within a given prediction window ahead of their actual arrival time thus avoiding the underutilization of the unlicensed spectrum during off-peak hours while maximizing the total served LTE-U traffic load. To this end, a noncooperative game model is formulated in which SBSs are modeled as Homo Egualis agents that aim at predicting a sequence of future actions and thus achieving long-term equal weighted fairness with WLAN and other LTE-U operators over a given time horizon. The proposed deep learning algorithm is then shown to reach a mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium (NE), when it converges. Simulation results using real data traces show that the proposed scheme can yield up to 28% and 11% gains over a conventional reactive approach and a proportional fair coexistence mechanism, respectively. The results also show that the proposed framework prevents WiFi performance degradation for a densely deployed LTE-U network.|lte unlicens spectrum lte promis approach overcom wireless spectrum scarciti howev reap benefit lte fair coexist mechan incumb wifi deploy requir paper novel deep learn approach propos model resourc alloc problem lte small base station sbss propos approach enabl multipl sbss proactiv perform dynam channel select carrier aggreg fraction spectrum access guarante fair exist wifi network lte oper adopt proactiv coexist mechan enabl futur delay intoler lte data demand serv within given predict window ahead actual arriv time thus avoid underutil unlicens spectrum dure peak hour maxim total serv lte traffic load end noncoop game model formul sbss model homo eguali agent aim predict sequenc futur action thus achiev long term equal weight fair wlan lte oper given time horizon propos deep learn algorithm shown reach mix strategi nash equilibrium ne converg simul result use real data trace show propos scheme yield gain convent reactiv approach proport fair coexist mechan respect result also show propos framework prevent wifi perform degrad dens deploy lte network|['Ursula Challita', 'Li Dong', 'Walid Saad']|['cs.IT', 'cs.AI', 'cs.GT', 'math.IT']

In essence, an ad option is a contract that gives an advertiser a right but not obligation to enter into transactions to purchase ad inventories such as page views or link clicks from a specific slot at one or multiple pre-specified prices in a specific future period. Compared to guaranteed contracts, the advertiser pays a lower upfront fee but can have greater flexibility and more control in advertising. So far ad option studies have been restricted to the situations where the option payoff is determined by the underlying auction payment price at a specific time point and the price evolution over time is assumed to be continuous. The former leads to a biased option payoff calculation and the latter is invalid empirically for many ad slots. This paper discusses a new option pricing framework which can be applied to a general situation. The option payoff is calculated based on the average price over a specific future period. As we use the general mean, our framework contains different payoff functions as special cases. Further, we use jump-diffusion stochastic models to describe the auction payment price movement, which have Markov and price discontinuity properties, and those properties are validated by our statistical investigation of ad auctions from different datasets. In the paper, we propose a general option pricing solution based on Monte Carlo simulation and also give an explicit pricing formula for a special case. The latter is also a generalisation of the option pricing models in some other recent developments.|advertis ad option recent studi novel guarante deliveri gd system onlin advertis essenc ad option contract give advertis right oblig enter transact purchas ad inventori page view link click specif slot one multipl pre specifi price specif futur period compar guarante contract advertis pay lower upfront fee greater flexibl control advertis far ad option studi restrict situat option payoff determin auction payment price specif time point price evolut time assum continu former lead bias option payoff calcul latter invalid empir mani ad slot paper discuss new option price framework appli general situat option payoff calcul base averag price specif futur period use general mean framework contain differ payoff function special case use jump diffus stochast model describ auction payment price movement markov price discontinu properti properti valid statist investig ad auction differ dataset paper propos general option price solut base mont carlo simul also give explicit price formula special case latter also generalis option price model recent develop|['Bowei Chen', 'Mohan S.

However, technical advantages do not necessarily translate to increased profit for service providers, or increased consumer surplus.

One key challenge in CIP is the ability to allocate resources, either personnel or cyber, to critical infrastructures with different vulnerability and criticality levels. In this work, a contract-theoretic approach is proposed to solve the problem of resource allocation in critical infrastructure with asymmetric information. A control center (CC) is used to design contracts and offer them to infrastructures' owners. A contract can be seen as an agreement between the CC and infrastructures using which the CC allocates resources and gets rewards in return. Contracts are designed in a way to maximize the CC's benefit and motivate each infrastructure to accept a contract and obtain proper resources for its protection. Infrastructures are defined by both vulnerability levels and criticality levels which are unknown to the CC. Therefore, each infrastructure can claim that it is the most vulnerable or critical to gain more resources.

A novel distributed graphical evolutionary game theoretic learning method is proposed. In the proposed game-theoretic method, agents only need to communicate their binary decisions rather than the real-valued beliefs with their neighbors, which endows the method with low communication complexity. Under mean field approximations, we theoretically analyze the steady state equilibria of the game and show that the evolutionarily stable states (ESSs) coincide with the decisions of the benchmark centralized detector. Numerical experiments are implemented to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed game-theoretic learning method.|work studi social learn problem agent network system collabor detect state natur base privat signal novel distribut graphic evolutionari game theoret learn method propos propos game theoret method agent onli need communic binari decis rather real valu belief neighbor endow method low communic complex mean field approxim theoret analyz steadi state equilibria game show evolutionarili stabl state esss coincid decis benchmark central detector numer experi implement confirm effect propos game theoret learn method|['Xuanyu Cao', 'K.

This data is typically required to develop and render people-centric services. In this paper, we address the privacy implication, optimal pricing, and bundling of people-centric services. We first define the inverse correlation between the service quality and privacy level from data analytics perspectives. We then present the profit maximization models of selling standalone, complementary, and substitute services. Specifically, the closed-form solutions of the optimal privacy level and subscription fee are derived to maximize the gross profit of service providers. For interrelated people-centric services, we show that cooperation by service bundling of complementary services is profitable compared to the separate sales but detrimental for substitutes. We also show that the market value of a service bundle is correlated with the degree of contingency between the interrelated services. Finally, we incorporate the profit sharing models from game theory for dividing the bundling profit among the cooperative service providers.|emerg sens technolog mobil crowdsens internet thing iot peopl centric data effici collect use analyt optim purpos data typic requir develop render peopl centric servic paper address privaci implic optim price bundl peopl centric servic first defin invers correl servic qualiti privaci level data analyt perspect present profit maxim model sell standalon complementari substitut servic specif close form solut optim privaci level subscript fee deriv maxim gross profit servic provid interrel peopl centric servic show cooper servic bundl complementari servic profit compar separ sale detriment substitut also show market valu servic bundl correl degre conting interrel servic final incorpor profit share model game theori divid bundl profit among cooper servic provid|['Mohammad Abu Alsheikh', 'Dusit Niyato', 'Derek Leong', 'Ping Wang', 'Zhu Han']|['cs.GT']

The classical absent-minded driver problem represents the case with limited information and it has bearing on the general area of communication and learning, social choice, mechanism design, auctions, theories of knowledge, belief, and rational agency. Within the framework of extensive games, this problem has applications to many artificial intelligence scenarios. It is obvious that the performance of the agent improves as information available increases. It is shown that a non-uniform assignment strategy for successive choices does better than a fixed probability strategy. We consider both classical and quantum approaches to the problem. We argue that the superior performance of quantum decisions with access to entanglement cannot be fairly compared to a classical algorithm. If the cognitive systems of agents are taken to have access to quantum resources, or have a quantum mechanical basis, then that can be leveraged into superior performance.|paper reconsid problem absent mind driver must choos altern differ payoff imperfect recal vari degre knowledg system classic absent mind driver problem repres case limit inform bear general area communic learn social choic mechan design auction theori knowledg belief ration agenc within framework extens game problem applic mani artifici intellig scenario obvious perform agent improv inform avail increas shown non uniform assign strategi success choic doe better fix probabl strategi consid classic quantum approach problem argu superior perform quantum decis access entangl cannot fair compar classic algorithm cognit system agent taken access quantum resourc quantum mechan basi leverag superior perform|['Subhash Kak']|['cs.AI', 'cs.GT']

Assuming that the hazard rate is bounded, it is possible to provide regret analyses for a variety of FTPL algorithms for the multi-armed bandit problem. This paper pushes the inquiry into regret bounds for FTPL algorithms beyond the bounded hazard rate condition. There are good reasons to do so: natural distributions such as the uniform and Gaussian violate the condition. We give regret bounds for both bounded support and unbounded support distributions without assuming the hazard rate condition. We also disprove a conjecture that the Gaussian distribution cannot lead to a low-regret algorithm. In fact, it turns out that it leads to near optimal regret, up to logarithmic factors. A key ingredient in our approach is the introduction of a new notion called the generalized hazard rate.|recent work follow perturb leader ftpl algorithm adversari multi arm bandit problem highlight role hazard rate distribut generat perturb assum hazard rate bound possibl provid regret analys varieti ftpl algorithm multi arm bandit problem paper push inquiri regret bound ftpl algorithm beyond bound hazard rate condit good reason natur distribut uniform gaussian violat condit give regret bound bound support unbound support distribut without assum hazard rate condit also disprov conjectur gaussian distribut cannot lead low regret algorithm fact turn lead near optim regret logarithm factor key ingredi approach introduct new notion call general hazard rate|['Zifan Li', 'Ambuj Tewari']|['cs.LG', 'cs.GT', 'stat.ML']

[BFRR14]: it aims at building system controllers that provide strict worst-case performance guarantees against an antagonistic environment while ensuring higher expected performance against a stochastic model of the environment. Our work extends the framework of [BFRR14] and follow-up papers, which focused on quantitative objectives, by addressing the case of $\omega$-regular conditions encoded as parity objectives, a natural way to represent functional requirements of systems.   We build strategies that satisfy a main parity objective on all plays, while ensuring a secondary one with sufficient probability. This setting raises new challenges in comparison to quantitative objectives, as one cannot easily mix different strategies without endangering the functional properties of the system. We establish that, for all variants of this problem, deciding the existence of a strategy lies in ${\sf NP} \cap {\sf coNP}$, the same complexity class as classical parity games. Hence, our framework provides additional modeling power while staying in the same complexity class.   [BFRR14] V\'eronique Bruy\`ere, Emmanuel Filiot, Mickael Randour, and Jean-Fran\c{c}ois Raskin.

These are multi-player games where each player models the state of nature using a worst-case distribution, also called adversarial distribution. Thus each player's payoff depends on the other players' decisions and on the decision of a virtual player (nature) who selects an adversarial distribution of scenarios. This paper provides three main contributions. Firstly, the distributionally robust game is formulated using the statistical notions of f-divergence between two distributions, here represented by the adversarial distribution, and the exact distribution. Secondly, the complexity of the problem is significantly reduced by means of triality theory. Thirdly, stochastic Bregman learning algorithms are proposed to speedup the computation of robust equilibria.

However, empathy-related changes in strategic decision-making and their relation to age, gender and neuropsychological functions have not been studied widely. In this article, we study a one-shot prisoner dilemma from a psychological game theory viewpoint. Forty seven participants (28 women and 19 men), aged 18 to 42 years, were tested with a empathy questionnaire and a one-shot prisoner dilemma questionnaire comprising a closiness option with the other participant. The percentage of cooperation and defection decisions was analyzed. A new empathetic payoff model was calculated to fit the observations from the test whether multi-dimensional empathy levels matter in the outcome. A significant level of cooperation is observed in the experimental one-shot game. The collected data suggests that perspective taking, empathic concern and fantasy scale are strongly correlated and have an important effect on cooperative decisions. However, their effect in the payoff is not additive. Mixed scales as well as other non-classified subscales (25+8 out of 47) were observed from the data.|strateg decis make involv affect cognit function like reason cognit emot empathi may subject age gender differ howev empathi relat chang strateg decis make relat age gender neuropsycholog function studi wide articl studi one shot prison dilemma psycholog game theori viewpoint forti seven particip women men age year test empathi questionnair one shot prison dilemma questionnair compris closi option particip percentag cooper defect decis analyz new empathet payoff model calcul fit observ test whether multi dimension empathi level matter outcom signific level cooper observ experiment one shot game collect data suggest perspect take empath concern fantasi scale strong correl import effect cooper decis howev effect payoff addit mix scale well non classifi subscal observ data|['Giulia Rossi', 'Alain Tcheukam', 'Hamidou Tembine']|['cs.GT']

This work presents some effects of users' psychology in mean-field-type games. In addition to the traditional ""material"" payoff modelling, psychological patterns are introduced in order to better capture and understand behaviors that are observed in engineering practice or in experimental settings. The psychological payoff value depends upon choices, mean-field states, mean-field actions, empathy and beliefs. It is shown that the affective empathy enforces mean-field equilibrium payoff equity and improves fairness between the players. It establishes equilibrium systems for such interactive decision-making problems. Basic empathy concepts are illustrated in several important problems in engineering including resource sharing, packet collision minimization, energy markets, and forwarding in Device-to-Device communications. The work conducts also an experiment with 47 people who have to decide whether to cooperate or not. The basic Interpersonal Reactivity Index of empathy metrics were used to measure the empathy distribution of each participant. Android app called Empathizer is developed to analyze systematically the data obtained from the participants. The experimental results reveal that the dominated strategies of the classical game theory are not dominated any more when users' psychology is involved, and a significant level of cooperation is observed among the users who are positively partially empathetic."|mean field type game theori focus cognit plausibl model choic human anim machin robot softwar defin mobil devic strateg interact work present effect user psycholog mean field type game addit tradit materi payoff model psycholog pattern introduc order better captur understand behavior observ engin practic experiment set psycholog payoff valu depend upon choic mean field state mean field action empathi belief shown affect empathi enforc mean field equilibrium payoff equiti improv fair player establish equilibrium system interact decis make problem basic empathi concept illustr sever import problem engin includ resourc share packet collis minim energi market forward devic devic communic work conduct also experi peopl decid whether cooper basic interperson reactiv index empathi metric use measur empathi distribut particip android app call empath develop analyz systemat data obtain particip experiment result reveal domin strategi classic game theori domin ani user psycholog involv signific level cooper observ among user posit partial empathet|['Giulia Rossi', 'Alain Tcheukam', 'Hamidou Tembine']|['cs.GT', 'cs.MA']

We investigate the acceleration of first-order methods for solving extensive-form games through better design of the dilated entropy function---a class of distance-generating functions related to the domains associated with the extensive-form games. By introducing a new weighting scheme for the dilated entropy function, we develop the first distance-generating function for the strategy spaces of sequential games that has no dependence on the branching factor of the player. This result improves the convergence rate of several first-order methods by a factor of $\Omega(b^dd)$, where $b$ is the branching factor of the player, and $d$ is the depth of the game tree.   Thus far, counterfactual regret minimization methods have been faster in practice, and more popular, than first-order methods despite their theoretically inferior convergence rates.

Informally, the capacity of a network is simply the total amount of information which it can transfer. In the context of models of wireless radio networks, this has usually meant the total number of point-to-point messages which can be sent or received in one time step. This definition has seen intensive study in recent years, particularly with respect to more accurate models of radio networks such as the SINR model. This paper is motivated by an obvious fact: radio antennae are (at least traditionally) omnidirectional, and hence point-to-point connections are not necessarily the best definition of capacity. To fix this, we introduce a new definition of capacity as the maximum number of messages which can be received in one round, and show that this is related to a new optimization problem we call the Maximum Perfect Dominated Set (MaxPDS) problem. Using this relationship we give tight upper and lower bounds for approximating the capacity. We also analyze this notion of capacity under game-theoretic constraints, giving tight bounds on both the Price of Anarchy and the Price of Stability.|capac wireless network classic import topic studi inform capac network simpli total amount inform transfer context model wireless radio network usual meant total number point point messag sent receiv one time step definit seen intens studi recent year particular respect accur model radio network sinr model paper motiv obvious fact radio antenna least tradit omnidirect henc point point connect necessarili best definit capac fix introduc new definit capac maximum number messag receiv one round show relat new optim problem call maximum perfect domin set maxpd problem use relationship give tight upper lower bound approxim capac also analyz notion capac game theoret constraint give tight bound price anarchi price stabil|['Michael Dinitz', 'Naomi Ephraim']|['cs.GT']

The challenge to the seller is to design a mechanism to incentivize the buyers, who are aware of the auction, to further propagate the information to their neighbors so that more buyers will participate in the auction and hence, the seller will be able to make a higher revenue. We propose a novel auction mechanism, called information diffusion mechanism (IDM), which incentivizes the buyers to not only truthfully report their valuations on the commodity to the seller, but also further propagate the auction information to all their neighbors. In comparison, the direct extension of the well-known Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism in social networks can also incentivize the information diffusion, but it will decrease the seller's revenue or even lead to a deficit sometimes. The formalization of the problem has not yet been addressed in the literature of mechanism design and our solution is very significant in the presence of large-scale online social networks.|paper studi auction design problem seller sell commod social network individu seller buyer onli communic neighbor challeng seller design mechan incentiv buyer awar auction propag inform neighbor buyer particip auction henc seller abl make higher revenu propos novel auction mechan call inform diffus mechan idm incentiv buyer onli truth report valuat commod seller also propag auction inform neighbor comparison direct extens well known vickrey clark grove vcg mechan social network also incentiv inform diffus decreas seller revenu even lead deficit sometim formal problem yet address literatur mechan design solut veri signific presenc larg scale onlin social network|['Bin Li', 'Dong Hao', 'Dengji Zhao', 'Tao Zhou']|['cs.GT']

The framework has proven popular within the multiagent community, however, almost invariably, the work to date has been restricted to the case of pure strategies. Such a focus is highly restrictive as the notion of randomised play is fundamental to the theory of strategic games -- even very simple games can fail to have pure-strategy equilibria, but every finite game has at least one equilibrium in mixed strategies.   To address this, the present work focuses on the complexity of algorithmic problems dealing with mixed strategies in Boolean games. The main result is that the problem of determining whether a two-player game has an equilibrium satisfying a given payoff constraint is NEXP-complete. Based on this result, we then demonstrate that a number of other decision problems, such as the uniqueness of an equilibrium or the satisfaction of a given formula in equilibrium, are either NEXP or coNEXP-complete. The proof techniques developed in the course of this are then used to show that the problem of deciding whether a given profile is in equilibrium is coNP^#P-hard, and the problem of deciding whether a Boolean game has a rational-valued equilibrium is NEXP-hard, and whether a two-player Boolean game has an irrational-valued equilibrium is NEXP-complete. Finally, we show that determining whether the value of a two-player zero-sum game exceeds a given threshold is EXP-complete.|boolean game succinct represent strateg game wherein player seek satisfi formula proposit logic select truth assign set proposit variabl control framework proven popular within multiag communiti howev almost invari work date restrict case pure strategi focus high restrict notion randomis play fundament theori strateg game even veri simpl game fail pure strategi equilibria everi finit game least one equilibrium mix strategi address present work focus complex algorithm problem deal mix strategi boolean game main result problem determin whether two player game equilibrium satisfi given payoff constraint nexp complet base result demonstr number decis problem uniqu equilibrium satisfact given formula equilibrium either nexp conexp complet proof techniqu develop cours use show problem decid whether given profil equilibrium conp hard problem decid whether boolean game ration valu equilibrium nexp hard whether two player boolean game irrat valu equilibrium nexp complet final show determin whether valu two player zero sum game exceed given threshold exp complet|['Egor Ianovski']|['cs.GT']

This paper makes three main contributions. First, it defines a model to reason formally about settings with selfish experts, and demonstrates that ""incentive compatible"" (IC) algorithms are closely related to the design of proper scoring rules. Designing a good IC algorithm is easy if the designer's loss function is quadratic, but for other loss functions, novel techniques are required. Second, we design IC algorithms with good performance guarantees for the absolute loss function. Third, we give a formal separation between the power of online prediction with selfish experts and online prediction with honest experts by proving lower bounds for both IC and non-IC algorithms. In particular, with selfish experts and the absolute loss function, there is no (randomized) algorithm for online prediction-IC or otherwise-with asymptotically vanishing regret."|consid problem binari predict expert advic set expert agenc seek maxim credibl paper make three main contribut first defin model reason formal set selfish expert demonstr incent compat ic algorithm close relat design proper score rule design good ic algorithm easi design loss function quadrat loss function novel techniqu requir second design ic algorithm good perform guarante absolut loss function third give formal separ power onlin predict selfish expert onlin predict honest expert prove lower bound ic non ic algorithm particular selfish expert absolut loss function random algorithm onlin predict ic otherwis asymptot vanish regret|['Tim Roughgarden', 'Okke Schrijvers']|['cs.GT']

However, the real-world deployment of such drone delivery systems faces many cyber-physical security challenges. In this paper, a novel mathematical framework for analyzing and enhancing the security of drone delivery systems is introduced. In this regard, a zero-sum network interdiction game is formulated between a vendor, operating a drone delivery system, and a malicious attacker. In this game, the vendor seeks to find the optimal path that its UAV should follow, to deliver a purchase from the vendor's warehouse to a customer location, to minimize the delivery time. Meanwhile, an attacker seeks to choose an optimal location to interdict the potential paths of the UAVs, so as to inflict cyber or physical damage to it, thus, maximizing its delivery time. First, the Nash equilibrium point of this game is characterized. Then, to capture the subjective behavior of both the vendor and attacker, new notions from prospect theory are incorporated into the game. These notions allow capturing the vendor's and attacker's i) subjective perception of attack success probabilities, and ii) their disparate subjective valuations of the achieved delivery times relative to a certain target delivery time. Simulation results have shown that the subjective decision making of the vendor and attacker leads to adopting risky path selection strategies which inflict delays to the delivery, thus, yielding unexpected delivery times which surpass the target delivery time set by the vendor."|use unman aerial vehicl uav deliveri system onlin good rapid becom global norm corrobor amazon prime air googl project wing project howev real world deploy drone deliveri system face mani cyber physic secur challeng paper novel mathemat framework analyz enhanc secur drone deliveri system introduc regard zero sum network interdict game formul vendor oper drone deliveri system malici attack game vendor seek find optim path uav follow deliv purchas vendor warehous custom locat minim deliveri time meanwhil attack seek choos optim locat interdict potenti path uav inflict cyber physic damag thus maxim deliveri time first nash equilibrium point game character captur subject behavior vendor attack new notion prospect theori incorpor game notion allow captur vendor attack subject percept attack success probabl ii dispar subject valuat achiev deliveri time relat certain target deliveri time simul result shown subject decis make vendor attack lead adopt riski path select strategi inflict delay deliveri thus yield unexpect deliveri time surpass target deliveri time set vendor|['Anibal Sanjab', 'Walid Saad', 'Tamer Başar']|['cs.GT', 'cs.IT', 'math.IT']

However, they necessarily treat the choice to cooperate or defect as an atomic action. In real-world social dilemmas these choices are temporally extended. Cooperativeness is a property that applies to policies, not elementary actions. We introduce sequential social dilemmas that share the mixed incentive structure of matrix game social dilemmas but also require agents to learn policies that implement their strategic intentions. We analyze the dynamics of policies learned by multiple self-interested independent learning agents, each using its own deep Q-network, on two Markov games we introduce here: 1. a fruit Gathering game and 2. a Wolfpack hunting game. We characterize how learned behavior in each domain changes as a function of environmental factors including resource abundance. Our experiments show how conflict can emerge from competition over shared resources and shed light on how the sequential nature of real world social dilemmas affects cooperation.|matrix game like prison dilemma guid research social dilemma decad howev necessarili treat choic cooper defect atom action real world social dilemma choic tempor extend cooper properti appli polici elementari action introduc sequenti social dilemma share mix incent structur matrix game social dilemma also requir agent learn polici implement strateg intent analyz dynam polici learn multipl self interest independ learn agent use deep network two markov game introduc fruit gather game wolfpack hunt game character learn behavior domain chang function environment factor includ resourc abund experi show conflict emerg competit share resourc shed light sequenti natur real world social dilemma affect cooper|['Joel Z.
