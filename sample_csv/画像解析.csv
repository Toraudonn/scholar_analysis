In the past, convex optimization with sparsity-promoting convex regularization was usually regarded as a standard scheme for estimating sparse signals in noise. However, using convex regularization can not still obtain the correct sparsity solution under some practical problems including image inverse problems. In this paper we propose a non-convex weighted $\ell_p$ minimization based group sparse representation (GSR) framework for image denoising. To make the proposed scheme tractable and robust, the generalized soft-thresholding (GST) algorithm is adopted to solve the non-convex $\ell_p$ minimization problem. In addition, to improve the accuracy of the nonlocal similar patches selection, an adaptive patch search (APS) scheme is proposed. Experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed approach not only outperforms many state-of-the-art denoising methods such as BM3D and WNNM, but also results in a competitive speed.",nonloc imag represent group sparsiti attract consider interest various low level vision task led sever state art imag denois techniqu bmd lssc past convex optim sparsiti promot convex regular usual regard standard scheme estim spars signal nois howev use convex regular still obtain correct sparsiti solut practic problem includ imag invers problem paper propos non convex weight ell minim base group spars represent gsr framework imag denois make propos scheme tractabl robust general soft threshold gst algorithm adopt solv non convex ell minim problem addit improv accuraci nonloc similar patch select adapt patch search ap scheme propos experiment result demonstr propos approach onli outperform mani state art denois method bmd wnnm also result competit speed,"['Qiong Wang', 'Xinggan Zhang', 'Yu Wu', 'Yechao Bai', 'Lan Tang', 'Zhiyuan Zha']",['cs.CV'],False,False,False,True,False,False

Early detection and timely treatment can reduce the occurrence of blindness due to DR. Computer-aided diagnosis has the potential benefit of improving the accuracy and speed in DR detection. This study is concerned with automatic classification of images with microaneurysm (MA) and neovascularization (NV), two important DR clinical findings. Together with normal images, this presents a 3-class classification problem. We propose a modified color auto-correlogram feature (AutoCC) with low dimensionality that is spectrally tuned towards DR images. Recognizing the fact that the images with or without MA or NV are generally different only in small, localized regions, we propose to employ a multi-class, multiple-instance learning framework for performing the classification task using the proposed feature. Extensive experiments including comparison with a few state-of-art image classification approaches have been performed and the results suggest that the proposed approach is promising as it outperforms other methods by a large margin.",peopl diabet risk develop diabet retinopathi dr vision threaten complic earli detect time treatment reduc occurr blind due dr comput aid diagnosi potenti benefit improv accuraci speed dr detect studi concern automat classif imag microaneurysm neovascular nv two import dr clinic find togeth normal imag present class classif problem propos modifi color auto correlogram featur autocc low dimension spectral tune toward dr imag recogn fact imag without nv general differ onli small local region propos employ multi class multipl instanc learn framework perform classif task use propos featur extens experi includ comparison state art imag classif approach perform result suggest propos approach promis outperform method larg margin,"['Ragav Venkatesan', 'Parag S.

In addition, photo capturing process has become trivial due to the advances in mobile imaging. Hence people capture a lot of photos everyday and they want them to be visually-attractive. This has given rise to automated, one-touch enhancement tools. However, the inability of those tools to provide personalized and content-adaptive enhancement has paved way for machine-learned methods to do the same. The existing typical machine-learned methods heuristically (e.g. kNN-search) predict the enhancement parameters for a new image by relating the image to a set of similar training images. These heuristic methods need constant interaction with the training images which makes the parameter prediction sub-optimal and computationally expensive at test time which is undesired. This paper presents a novel approach to predicting the enhancement parameters given a new image using only its features, without using any training images. We propose to model the interaction between the image features and its corresponding enhancement parameters using the matrix factorization (MF) principles. We also propose a way to integrate the image features in the MF formulation. We show that our approach outperforms heuristic approaches as well as recent approaches in MF and structured prediction on synthetic as well as real-world data of image enhancement.",social network mobil devic becom commonplac everyday life addit photo captur process becom trivial due advanc mobil imag henc peopl captur lot photo everyday want visual attract given rise autom one touch enhanc tool howev inabl tool provid person content adapt enhanc pave way machin learn method exist typic machin learn method heurist knn search predict enhanc paramet new imag relat imag set similar train imag heurist method need constant interact train imag make paramet predict sub optim comput expens test time undesir paper present novel approach predict enhanc paramet given new imag use onli featur without use ani train imag propos model interact imag featur correspond enhanc paramet use matrix factor mf principl also propos way integr imag featur mf formul show approach outperform heurist approach well recent approach mf structur predict synthet well real world data imag enhanc,"['Parag S.

Many of the existing leading methods employ machine-learning-based techniques, by which some enhancement parameters for a given image are found by relating the image to the training images with known enhancement parameters. While knowing the structure of the parameter space can facilitate search for the optimal solution, none of the existing methods has explicitly modeled and learned that structure. This paper presents an end-to-end, novel joint regression and ranking approach to model the interaction between desired enhancement parameters and images to be processed, employing a Gaussian process (GP). GP allows searching for ideal parameters using only the image features. The model naturally leads to a ranking technique for comparing images in the induced feature space. Comparative evaluation using the ground-truth based on the MIT-Adobe FiveK dataset plus subjective tests on an additional data-set were used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",research autom imag enhanc gain momentum recent year partial due need easi use tool enhanc pictur captur ubiquit camera mobil devic mani exist lead method employ machin learn base techniqu enhanc paramet given imag found relat imag train imag known enhanc paramet know structur paramet space facilit search optim solut none exist method explicit model learn structur paper present end end novel joint regress rank approach model interact desir enhanc paramet imag process employ gaussian process gp gp allow search ideal paramet use onli imag featur model natur lead rank techniqu compar imag induc featur space compar evalu use ground truth base mit adob fivek dataset plus subject test addit data set use demonstr effect propos approach,"['Parag S.

The new architecture performs multiplicative transformations and share parameters of these transformations according to the subdivisions of the point clouds imposed onto them by Kd-trees. Unlike the currently dominant convolutional architectures that usually require rasterization on uniform two-dimensional or three-dimensional grids, Kd-networks do not rely on such grids in any way and therefore avoid poor scaling behaviour.

Inspired by the exemplary results obtained via automatic feature learning and deep learning approaches in computer vision, we focus our attention towards learning salient spatial features via a convolutional neural network (CNN) and then map their temporal relationship with the aid of Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) networks. Our contribution in this paper is a deep fusion framework that more effectively exploits spatial features from CNNs with temporal features from LSTM models. We also extensively evaluate their strengths and weaknesses. We find that by combining both the sets of features, the fully connected features effectively act as an attention mechanism to direct the LSTM to interesting parts of the convolutional feature sequence. The significance of our fusion method is its simplicity and effectiveness compared to other state-of-the-art methods. The evaluation results demonstrate that this hierarchical multi stream fusion method has higher performance compared to single stream mapping methods allowing it to achieve high accuracy outperforming current state-of-the-art methods in three widely used databases: UCF11, UCFSports, jHMDB.",paper address problem human action recognit video sequenc inspir exemplari result obtain via automat featur learn deep learn approach comput vision focus attent toward learn salient spatial featur via convolut neural network cnn map tempor relationship aid long short term memori lstm network contribut paper deep fusion framework effect exploit spatial featur cnns tempor featur lstm model also extens evalu strength weak find combin set featur fulli connect featur effect act attent mechan direct lstm interest part convolut featur sequenc signific fusion method simplic effect compar state art method evalu result demonstr hierarch multi stream fusion method higher perform compar singl stream map method allow achiev high accuraci outperform current state art method three wide use databas ucf ucfsport jhmdb,"['Harshala Gammulle', 'Simon Denman', 'Sridha Sridharan', 'Clinton Fookes']",['cs.CV'],False,False,False,True,False,False

Such examples, typically generated by adding small but purposeful distortions, can frequently fool DNN models. Previous studies to defend against adversarial examples mostly focused on refining the DNN models. They have either shown limited success or suffer from the expensive computation. We propose a new strategy, \emph{feature squeezing}, that can be used to harden DNN models by detecting adversarial examples. Feature squeezing reduces the search space available to an adversary by coalescing samples that correspond to many different feature vectors in the original space into a single sample. By comparing a DNN model's prediction on the original input with that on the squeezed input, feature squeezing detects adversarial examples with high accuracy and few false positives. This paper explores two instances of feature squeezing: reducing the color bit depth of each pixel and smoothing using a spatial filter. These strategies are straightforward, inexpensive, and complementary to defensive methods that operate on the underlying model, such as adversarial training.",although deep neural network dnns achiev great success mani comput vision task recent studi shown vulner adversari exampl exampl typic generat ad small purpos distort frequent fool dnn model previous studi defend adversari exampl focus refin dnn model either shown limit success suffer expens comput propos new strategi emph featur squeez use harden dnn model detect adversari exampl featur squeez reduc search space avail adversari coalesc sampl correspond mani differ featur vector origin space singl sampl compar dnn model predict origin input squeez input featur squeez detect adversari exampl high accuraci fals posit paper explor two instanc featur squeez reduc color bit depth pixel smooth use spatial filter strategi straightforward inexpens complementari defens method oper model adversari train,"['Weilin Xu', 'David Evans', 'Yanjun Qi']","['cs.CV', 'cs.CR', 'cs.LG']",True,False,False,True,False,False

Our approach takes as input a sequence of ground-level images acquired by the vehicle as it navigates, and outputs an estimate of the vehicle's pose relative to a georeferenced satellite image. We overcome the significant viewpoint and appearance variations between the images through a neural multi-view model that learns location-discriminative embeddings in which ground-level images are matched with their corresponding satellite view of the scene. We use this learned function as an observation model in a filtering framework to maintain a distribution over the vehicle's pose.
