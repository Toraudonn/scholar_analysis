In this paper, we investigate the interaction between denoising and classification on large scale dataset. Inspired by classification models, we propose a novel deep learning architecture for color (multichannel) image denoising and report on thousands of images from ImageNet dataset as well as commonly used imagery. We study the importance of (sufficient) training data, how semantic class information can be traded for improved denoising results. As a result, our method greatly improves PSNR performance by 0.34 - 0.51 dB on average over state-of-the art methods on large scale dataset. We conclude that it is beneficial to incorporate in classification models. On the other hand, we also study how noise affect classification performance. In the end, we come to a number of interesting conclusions, some being counter-intuitive.",larg amount imag denois literatur focus singl channel imag often experiment valid propos method ten imag paper investig interact denois classif larg scale dataset inspir classif model propos novel deep learn architectur color multichannel imag denois report thousand imag imagenet dataset well common use imageri studi import suffici train data semant class inform trade improv denois result result method great improv psnr perform db averag state art method larg scale dataset conclud benefici incorpor classif model hand also studi nois affect classif perform end come number interest conclus counter intuit,"['Jiqing Wu', 'Radu Timofte', 'Zhiwu Huang', 'Luc Van Gool']",['cs.CV'],True,False,False,False,False,False

This paper presents a relative-learning-based approach, which, unlike previous methods, does not require matching original and enhanced images for training. This allows the use of massive online photo collections to train a ranking model for improved enhancement. We first propose a multi-level ranking model, which is learned from only relatively-labeled inputs that are automatically crawled. Then we design a novel parameter sampling scheme under this model to generate the desired enhancement parameters for a new image. For evaluation, we first verify the effectiveness and the generalization abilities of our approach, using images that have been enhanced/labeled by experts. Then we carry out subjective tests, which show that users prefer images enhanced by our approach over other existing methods.",person content adapt imag enhanc find mani applic age social media mobil comput paper present relat learn base approach unlik previous method doe requir match origin enhanc imag train allow use massiv onlin photo collect train rank model improv enhanc first propos multi level rank model learn onli relat label input automat crawl design novel paramet sampl scheme model generat desir enhanc paramet new imag evalu first verifi effect general abil approach use imag enhanc label expert carri subject test show user prefer imag enhanc approach exist method,"['Parag S.

Many of the existing leading methods employ machine-learning-based techniques, by which some enhancement parameters for a given image are found by relating the image to the training images with known enhancement parameters. While knowing the structure of the parameter space can facilitate search for the optimal solution, none of the existing methods has explicitly modeled and learned that structure. This paper presents an end-to-end, novel joint regression and ranking approach to model the interaction between desired enhancement parameters and images to be processed, employing a Gaussian process (GP). GP allows searching for ideal parameters using only the image features. The model naturally leads to a ranking technique for comparing images in the induced feature space. Comparative evaluation using the ground-truth based on the MIT-Adobe FiveK dataset plus subjective tests on an additional data-set were used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",research autom imag enhanc gain momentum recent year partial due need easi use tool enhanc pictur captur ubiquit camera mobil devic mani exist lead method employ machin learn base techniqu enhanc paramet given imag found relat imag train imag known enhanc paramet know structur paramet space facilit search optim solut none exist method explicit model learn structur paper present end end novel joint regress rank approach model interact desir enhanc paramet imag process employ gaussian process gp gp allow search ideal paramet use onli imag featur model natur lead rank techniqu compar imag induc featur space compar evalu use ground truth base mit adob fivek dataset plus subject test addit data set use demonstr effect propos approach,"['Parag S.

Such examples, typically generated by adding small but purposeful distortions, can frequently fool DNN models. Previous studies to defend against adversarial examples mostly focused on refining the DNN models. They have either shown limited success or suffer from the expensive computation. We propose a new strategy, \emph{feature squeezing}, that can be used to harden DNN models by detecting adversarial examples. Feature squeezing reduces the search space available to an adversary by coalescing samples that correspond to many different feature vectors in the original space into a single sample. By comparing a DNN model's prediction on the original input with that on the squeezed input, feature squeezing detects adversarial examples with high accuracy and few false positives. This paper explores two instances of feature squeezing: reducing the color bit depth of each pixel and smoothing using a spatial filter. These strategies are straightforward, inexpensive, and complementary to defensive methods that operate on the underlying model, such as adversarial training.",although deep neural network dnns achiev great success mani comput vision task recent studi shown vulner adversari exampl exampl typic generat ad small purpos distort frequent fool dnn model previous studi defend adversari exampl focus refin dnn model either shown limit success suffer expens comput propos new strategi emph featur squeez use harden dnn model detect adversari exampl featur squeez reduc search space avail adversari coalesc sampl correspond mani differ featur vector origin space singl sampl compar dnn model predict origin input squeez input featur squeez detect adversari exampl high accuraci fals posit paper explor two instanc featur squeez reduc color bit depth pixel smooth use spatial filter strategi straightforward inexpens complementari defens method oper model adversari train,"['Weilin Xu', 'David Evans', 'Yanjun Qi']","['cs.CV', 'cs.CR', 'cs.LG']",True,False,False,True,False,False
