We use two indices of the influence of those nodes, namely, PageRank and a Max-linear model. We consider the PageRank %both as %Galton-Watson branching process and as an autoregressive process with a random number of random coefficients that depend on ranks of incoming nodes and their out-degrees and assume that the coefficients are independent and distributed with regularly varying tail and with the same tail index. Then it is proved that the tail index and the extremal index are the same for both PageRank and the Max-linear model and the values of these indices are found. The achievements are based on the study of random sequences of a random length and the comparison of the distribution of their maxima and linear combinations.",regard analysi web communic social complex network fast find influenti node network graph constitut import research problem use two indic influenc node name pagerank max linear model consid pagerank galton watson branch process autoregress process random number random coeffici depend rank incom node degre assum coeffici independ distribut regular vari tail tail index prove tail index extrem index pagerank max linear model valu indic found achiev base studi random sequenc random length comparison distribut maxima linear combin,['Natalia Markovich'],"['math.ST', 'stat.TH']",False,True,False,False,False,False

In this paper, we propose a new task that aims at parsing scenes with a large and open vocabulary, and several evaluation metrics are explored for this problem. Our proposed approach to this problem is a joint image pixel and word concept embeddings framework, where word concepts are connected by semantic relations. We validate the open vocabulary prediction ability of our framework on ADE20K dataset which covers a wide variety of scenes and objects. We further explore the trained joint embedding space to show its interpretability.",recogn arbitrari object wild challeng problem due limit exist classif model dataset paper propos new task aim pars scene larg open vocabulari sever evalu metric explor problem propos approach problem joint imag pixel word concept embed framework word concept connect semant relat valid open vocabulari predict abil framework adek dataset cover wide varieti scene object explor train joint embed space show interpret,"['Hang Zhao', 'Xavier Puig', 'Bolei Zhou', 'Sanja Fidler', 'Antonio Torralba']","['cs.CV', 'cs.AI']",False,True,False,False,False,False

In this paper, we propose Emotional Chatting Machine (ECM) which generates responses that are appropriate not only at the content level (relevant and grammatical) but also at the emotion level (consistent emotional expression). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that addresses the emotion factor in large-scale conversation generation. ECM addresses the factor in three ways: modeling high-level abstraction of emotion expression by embedding emotion categories, changing of implicit internal emotion states, and using explicit emotion expressions with an external emotion vocabulary. Experiments show that our model can generate responses appropriate not only in content but also in emotion.",emot intellig one key factor success dialogu system convers agent paper propos emot chat machin ecm generat respons appropri onli content level relev grammat also emot level consist emot express best knowledg first work address emot factor larg scale convers generat ecm address factor three way model high level abstract emot express embed emot categori chang implicit intern emot state use explicit emot express extern emot vocabulari experi show model generat respons appropri onli content also emot,"['Hao Zhou', 'Minlie Huang', 'Tianyang Zhang', 'Xiaoyan Zhu', 'Bing Liu']",['cs.CL'],False,True,False,False,False,False

Existing state-of-art methods formulate this as a binary classification task where a given image is predicted to be beautiful or not. In many applications such as image retrieval and enhancement, it is more important to rank images based on their aesthetic quality instead of binary-categorizing them. Furthermore, in such applications, it may be possible that all images belong to the same category. Hence determining the aesthetic ranking of the images is more appropriate. To this end, we formulate a novel problem of ranking images with respect to their aesthetic quality. We construct a new dataset of image pairs with relative labels by carefully selecting images from the popular AVA dataset. Unlike in aesthetics classification, there is no single threshold which would determine the ranking order of the images across our entire dataset. We propose a deep neural network based approach that is trained on image pairs by incorporating principles from relative learning. Results show that such relative training procedure allows our network to rank the images with a higher accuracy than a state-of-art network trained on the same set of images using binary labels.",comput visual aesthet recent becom activ research area exist state art method formul binari classif task given imag predict beauti mani applic imag retriev enhanc import rank imag base aesthet qualiti instead binari categor furthermor applic may possibl imag belong categori henc determin aesthet rank imag appropri end formul novel problem rank imag respect aesthet qualiti construct new dataset imag pair relat label care select imag popular ava dataset unlik aesthet classif singl threshold would determin rank order imag across entir dataset propos deep neural network base approach train imag pair incorpor principl relat learn result show relat train procedur allow network rank imag higher accuraci state art network train set imag use binari label,"['Parag S.
