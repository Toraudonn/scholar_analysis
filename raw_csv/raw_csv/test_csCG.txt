We propose a robust non-rigid registration method using reweighted sparsities on position and transformation to estimate the deformations between 3-D shapes. We formulate the energy function with dual sparsities on both the data term and the smoothness term, and define the smoothness constraint using local rigidity. The dual-sparsity based non-rigid registration model is enhanced with a reweighting scheme, and solved by transferring the model into some alternating optimized subproblems which have exact solutions and guaranteed convergence. Experimental results on both public datasets and real scanned datasets show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and is more robust to noise and outliers than conventional non-rigid registration methods.|['Jingyu Yang', 'Kun Li', 'Yu-Kun Lai', 'Daoliang Guo']|['cs.CV', 'cs.CG', 'cs.GR']

We are particularly interested in a class of fractals called discrete self-similar fractals (a class of fractals that includes the discrete Sierpinski's carpet). We present a 2HAM system that strictly self-assembles the discrete Sierpinski's carpet with scale factor 1. Moreover, the 2HAM system that we give lends itself to being generalized and we describe how this system can be modified to obtain a 2HAM system that strictly self-assembles one of any fractal from an infinite set of fractals which we call 4-sided fractals. The 2HAM systems we give in this paper are the first examples of systems that strictly self-assemble discrete self-similar fractals at scale factor 1 in a purely growth model of self-assembly. Finally, we give an example of a 3-sided fractal (which is not a tree fractal) that cannot be strictly self-assembled by any 2HAM system.|['Jacob Hendricks', 'Joseph Opseth']|['cs.ET', 'cs.CG']

Contrasting this, the best known polynomial time algorithm for the problem has an approximation ratio of~$n^{\varepsilon}$. Surprisingly, we can extend the algorithm to the problem of computing the maximum weight subset of the given set of polygons whose intersection graph fulfills some sparsity condition. For example, we show that one can approximate the maximum weight subset of polygons, such that the intersection graph of the subset is planar or does not contain a cycle of length $4$ (i.e., $K_{2,2}$). Our algorithm relies on a recursive partitioning scheme, whose backbone is the existence of balanced cuts with small complexity that intersect polygons from the optimal solution of a small total weight.   For the case of large axis-parallel rectangles, we provide a polynomial time $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation for the maximum weight independent set. Specifically, we consider the problem where each rectangle has one edge whose length is at least a constant fraction of the length of the corresponding edge of the bounding box of all the input elements.

Three types of bicriteria rectilinear paths are considered: minimum-link shortest paths, shortest minimum-link paths, and minimum-cost paths where the cost of a path is a non-decreasing function of both the number of edges and the length of the path. The one-point and two-point path queries are also considered. Algorithms for these problems have been given previously. Our contributions are threefold. First, we find a critical error in all previous algorithms. Second, we correct the error in a not-so-trivial way. Third, we further improve the algorithms so that they are even faster than the previous (incorrect) algorithms when $h$ is relatively small. For example, for the minimum-link shortest paths, we obtain the following results. Our algorithm computes a minimum-link shortest $s$-$t$ path in $O(n+h\log^{3/2} h)$ time. For the one-point queries, we build a data structure of size $O(n+ h\log h)$ in $O(n+h\log^{3/2} h)$ time for a source point $s$, such that given any query point $t$, a minimum-link shortest $s$-$t$ path can be determined in $O(\log n)$ time. For the two-point queries, with $O(n+h^2\log^2 h)$ time and space preprocessing, a minimum-link shortest $s$-$t$ path can be determined in $O(\log n+\log^2 h)$ time for any two query points $s$ and $t$; alternatively, with $O(n+h^2\cdot \log^{2} h \cdot 4^{\sqrt{\log h}})$ time and $O(n+h^2\cdot \log h \cdot 4^{\sqrt{\log h}})$ space preprocessing, we can answer each two-point query in $O(\log n)$ time.|['Haitao Wang']|['cs.CG', 'cs.DS']

By universal we mean that every planar graph of degree $\Delta$ has a planar drawing with at most one bend per edge and such that the slopes of the segments forming the edges belong to the given set of slopes. This improves over previous results in two ways: Firstly, the best previously known upper bound for the 1-bend planar slope number was $\frac{3}{2} (\Delta -1)$ (the known lower bound being $\frac{3}{4} (\Delta -1)$); secondly, all the known algorithms to construct 1-bend planar drawings with $O(\Delta)$ slopes use a different set of slopes for each graph and can have bad angular resolution, while our algorithm uses a universal set of slopes, which also guarantees that the minimum angle between any two edges incident to a vertex is $\frac{\pi}{(\Delta-1)}$.|['Patrizio Angelini', 'Michael A.

However, current 3D learning paradigms for predictive and generative tasks using convolutional neural networks focus on a voxelized representation of the object. Lifting convolution operators from the traditional 2D to 3D results in high computational overhead with little additional benefit as most of the geometry information is contained on the surface boundary. Here we study the problem of directly generating the 3D shape surface of rigid and non-rigid shapes using deep convolutional neural networks. We develop a procedure to create consistent `geometry images' representing the shape surface of a category of 3D objects. We then use this consistent representation for category-specific shape surface generation from a parametric representation or an image by developing novel extensions of deep residual networks for the task of geometry image generation. Our experiments indicate that our network learns a meaningful representation of shape surfaces allowing it to interpolate between shape orientations and poses, invent new shape surfaces and reconstruct 3D shape surfaces from previously unseen images.|['Ayan Sinha', 'Asim Unmesh', 'Qixing Huang', 'Karthik Ramani']|['cs.CV', 'cs.CG']

To this end we devise the first locality-sensitive hashing schemes for these distance measures. A major challenge is posed by the fact that these distance measures internally optimize the alignment between the curves. We give solutions for different types of alignments including constrained and unconstrained versions. For unconstrained alignments, we improve over a result by Indyk from 2002 for short curves. Let $n$ be the number of input curves and let $m$ be the maximum complexity of a curve in the input. In the particular case where $m \leq \frac{\alpha}{4d} \log n$, for some fixed $\alpha>0$, our solutions imply an approximate near-neighbor data structure for the discrete Fr\'echet distance that uses space in $O(n^{1+\alpha}\log n)$ and achieves query time in $O(n^{\alpha}\log^2 n)$ and constant approximation factor. Furthermore, our solutions provide a trade-off between approximation quality and computational performance: for any parameter $k \in [m]$, we can give a data structure that uses space in $O(2^{2k}m^{k-1} n \log n + nm)$, answers queries in $O( 2^{2k} m^{k}\log n)$ time and achieves approximation factor in $O(m/k)$.|['Anne Driemel', 'Francesco Silvestri']|['cs.CG', 'cs.DS', 'cs.IR', 'F.2.2']

Littlewood (1885 - 1977): Can two lions catch a man in a bounded area with rectifiable lakes? The lions and the man are all assumed to be points moving with at most unit speed. That the lakes are rectifiable means that their boundaries are finitely long. This requirement is to avoid pathological examples where the man survives forever because any path to the lions is infinitely long. We show that the answer to the question is not always ""yes"" by giving an example of a region $R$ in the plane where the man has a strategy to survive forever. $R$ is a polygonal region with holes and the exterior and interior boundaries are pairwise disjoint, simple polygons. Our construction is the first truly two-dimensional example where the man can survive.   Next, we consider the following game played on the entire plane instead of a bounded area: There is any finite number of unit speed lions and one fast man who can run with speed $1+\varepsilon$ for some value $\varepsilon>0$. Can the man always survive?

We introduce a new method for proving dynamic cell probe lower bounds and use it to prove a $\tilde{\Omega}(\log^{1.5} n)$ lower bound on the operational time of a wide range of boolean data structure problems, most notably, on the query time of dynamic range counting over $\mathbb{F}_2$ ([Pat07]). Proving an $\omega(\lg n)$ lower bound for this problem was explicitly posed as one of five important open problems in the late Mihai P\v{a}tra\c{s}cu's obituary [Tho13]. This result also implies the first $\omega(\lg n)$ lower bound for the classical 2D range counting problem, one of the most fundamental data structure problems in computational geometry and spatial databases. We derive similar lower bounds for boolean versions of dynamic polynomial evaluation and 2D rectangle stabbing, and for the (non-boolean) problems of range selection and range median.   Our technical centerpiece is a new way of ""weakly"" simulating dynamic data structures using efficient one-way communication protocols with small advantage over random guessing. This simulation involves a surprising excursion to low-degree (Chebychev) polynomials which may be of independent interest, and offers an entirely new algorithmic angle on the ""cell sampling"" method of Panigrahy et al.

We consider a quickest visibility query problem. Given a query point $q$ in $\mathcal{P}$, the goal is to find a shortest path in $\mathcal{P}$ to move from $s$ to see $q$ as quickly as possible. Previously, Arkin et al. (SoCG 2015) built a data structure of size $O(n^22^{\alpha(n)}\log n)$ that can answer each query in $O(K\log^2 n)$ time, where $\alpha(n)$ is the inverse Ackermann function and $K$ is the size of the visibility polygon of $q$ in $\mathcal{P}$ (and $K$ can be $\Theta(n)$ in the worst case). In this paper, we present a new data structure of size $O(n\log h + h^2)$ that can answer each query in $O(h\log h\log n)$ time. Our result improves the previous work when $h$ is relatively small. In particular, if $h$ is a constant, then our result even matches the best result for the simple polygon case (i.e., $h=1$), which is optimal. As a by-product, we also have a new algorithm for a shortest-path-to-segment query problem. Given a query line segment $\tau$ in $\mathcal{P}$, the query seeks a shortest path from $s$ to all points of $\tau$. Previously, Arkin et al. gave a data structure of size $O(n^22^{\alpha(n)}\log n)$ that can answer each query in $O(\log^2 n)$ time, and another data structure of size $O(n^3\log n)$ with $O(\log n)$ query time.

Defining good metrics between these objects has become an important question for applications, where it matters to quantify the extent by which two given Reeb graphs differ. Recent contributions emphasize this aspect, proposing novel distances such as {\em functional distortion} or {\em interleaving} that are provably more discriminative than the so-called {\em bottleneck distance}, being true metrics whereas the latter is only a pseudo-metric. Their main drawback compared to the bottleneck distance is to be comparatively hard (if at all possible) to evaluate. Here we take the opposite view on the problem and show that the bottleneck distance is in fact good enough {\em locally}, in the sense that it is able to discriminate a Reeb graph from any other Reeb graph in a small enough neighborhood, as efficiently as the other metrics do. This suggests considering the {\em intrinsic metrics} induced by these distances, which turn out to be all {\em globally} equivalent. This novel viewpoint on the study of Reeb graphs has a potential impact on applications, where one may not only be interested in discriminating between data but also in interpolating between them.|['Mathieu Carri√®re', 'Steve Oudot']|['cs.CG', 'math.AT']

We propose a tree structure constructed from the boundary of the farthest-point Voronoi diagram and use the hierarchical relationship between edges to locate the optimal solution. The plane could be divide into at most $3n-4$ non-overlapping regions. When $p$ lies in one of the regions, the optimal solution locates at one node or lies on the interior of one edge in the boundary of the farthest-point Voronoi diagram.

The underlying idea in the definition of dHT is to measure the minimal shift that is necessary to apply to one of the two functions in order that the sublevel sets of the two functions become homotopically equivalent. This distance is interesting in connection with persistent homology. Indeed, our main result states that dHT still provides an upper bound for the bottleneck distance between the persistence diagrams of the intervening functions. Moreover, because homotopy equivalences are weaker than homeomorphisms, this implies a lifting of the standard stability results provided by the L-infty distance and the natural pseudo-distance dNP. From a different standpoint, we prove that dHT extends the L-infty distance and dNP in two ways. First, we show that, appropriately restricting the category of objects to which dHT applies, it can be made to coincide with the other two distances. Finally, we show that dHT has an interpretation in terms of interleavings that naturally places it in the family of distances used in persistence theory.|['Patrizio Frosini', 'Claudia Landi', 'Facundo Memoli']|['cs.CG', 'math.AT']

The spherical depth $\SphD(q;S)$ is also defined for an arbitrary data set $S\subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$ and $q\in \mathbb{R}^d$. This definition is based on counting all of the closed hyper-balls, obtained from pairs of points in $S$, that contain $q$. The significant advantage of using the spherical depth in multivariate data analysis is related to its complexity of computation. Unlike most other data depths, the time complexity of the spherical depth grows linearly rather than exponentially in the dimension $d$. The straightforward algorithm for computing the spherical depth in dimension $d$ takes $O(dn^2)$. The main result of this paper is an optimal algorithm that we present for computing the bivariate spherical depth. The algorithm takes $O(n \log n)$ time. By reducing the problem of \textit{Element Uniqueness}, we prove that computing the spherical depth requires $\Omega(n \log n)$ time. Some geometric properties of spherical depth are also investigated in this paper. These properties indicate that \emph{simplicial depth} ($\SD$) (Liu, 1990) is linearly bounded by spherical depth (in particular, $\SphD\geq \frac{2}{3}SD$). To illustrate this relationship between the spherical depth and the simplicial depth, some experimental results are provided. The obtained experimental bound ($\SphD\geq 2\SD$) indicates that, perhaps, a stronger theoretical bound can be achieved.|['David Bremner', 'Rasoul Shahsavarifar']|['cs.CG']

The $\delta$-Greedy spanner combines the most desirable properties of geometric spanners both in theory and in practice. More specifically, it has the same theoretical and practical properties as the Path-Greedy spanner: a natural definition, small degree, linear number of edges, low weight, and strong $(1+\varepsilon)$-spanner for every $\varepsilon>0$. The $\delta$-Greedy algorithm is an improvement over the Path-Greedy algorithm with respect to the number of shortest path queries and hence with respect to its construction time. We show how to construct such a spanner for a set of $n$ points in the plane in $O(n^2 \log n)$ time.   The $\delta$-Greedy spanner has an additional parameter, $\delta$, which indicates how close it is to the Path-Greedy spanner on the account of the number of shortest path queries. For $\delta = t$ the output spanner is identical to the Path-Greedy spanner, while the number of shortest path queries is, in practice, linear.   Finally, we show that for a set of $n$ points placed independently at random in a unit square the expected construction time of the $\delta$-Greedy algorithm is $O(n \log n)$. Our analysis indicates that the $\delta$-Greedy spanner gives the best results among the known spanners of expected $O(n \log n)$ time for random point sets.

Experiments later showed that using a set of \textit{orthogonal} hyperplanes, thereby partitioning the space into the Voronoi regions induced by a hypercube, leads to even better results [Terasawa and Tanaka, WADS 2007]. However, no theoretical explanation for this improvement was ever given, and it remained unclear how the resulting hypercube hash method scales in high dimensions.   In this work, we provide explicit asymptotics for the collision probabilities when using hypercubes to partition the space. For instance, two near-orthogonal vectors are expected to collide with probability $(\frac{1}{\pi})^{d + o(d)}$ in dimension $d$, compared to $(\frac{1}{2})^d$ when using random hyperplanes. Vectors at angle $\frac{\pi}{3}$ collide with probability $(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{\pi})^{d + o(d)}$, compared to $(\frac{2}{3})^d$ for random hyperplanes, and near-parallel vectors collide with similar asymptotic probabilities in both cases.   For $c$-approximate nearest neighbor searching, this translates to a decrease in the exponent $\rho$ of locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) methods of a factor up to $\log_2(\pi) \approx 1.652$ compared to hyperplane LSH. For $c = 2$, we obtain $\rho \approx 0.302 + o(1)$ for hypercube LSH, improving upon the $\rho \approx 0.377$ for hyperplane LSH.

Although understory trees provide limited financial value, they offer habitat for numerous wildlife species and are important for stand development. Here we model tree identification accuracy according to point cloud density by decomposing lidar point cloud into overstory and multiple understory canopy layers, estimating the fraction of points representing the different layers, and inspecting tree identification accuracy as a function of point density. We show at a density of about 170 pt/m2 understory tree identification accuracy likely plateaus, which we regard as the required point density for reasonable identification of understory trees. Given the advancements of lidar sensor technology, point clouds can feasibly reach the required density to enable effective identification of individual understory trees, ultimately making remote quantification of forest resources more accurate.

In this paper, we present a polyhedral study of 2-level polytopes arising in combinatorial settings. For all the known (to the best of our knowledge) such polytopes P, we show that v(P).f(P) is upper bounded by d2^(d+1). Here v(P) (resp. f(P)) is the number of vertices (resp. facets) of P, and d is its dimension. Whether this holds for all 2-level polytopes was asked in [Bohn et al., ESA 2015], where experimental results showed it true up to dimension 6. The key to most of our proofs is an understanding of the combinatorial structures underlying those polytopes. This leads to a number of results that we believe to be of independent interest: a trade-off formula for the number of cliques and stable sets in a graph; a description of the facets of the base polytope of the 2-sum of matroids; a linear-size description of the base polytope of matroids that are 2-level in terms of cuts of an associated tree.

This signature is based on the distance to a measure (DTM) introduced by Chazal, Cohen-Steiner and M\'erigot. It leads to a pseudo-metric between metric-measure spaces, upper-bounded by the Gromov-Wasserstein distance. Under some geometric assumptions, we derive lower bounds for this pseudo-metric.

We want to place $m$ copies of $D$ such that the sum of the weights of the points in $\mathcal{P}$ covered by these copies is maximized.

In order to not spoil or clutter the figure with text, the labels are often placed around the figure and are associated by thin connecting lines to their features, respectively. This labeling technique is known as external label placement.   In this paper we introduce a flexible and general approach for external label placement assuming a contour of the figure prescribing the possible positions of the labels. While much research on external label placement aims for fast labeling procedures for interactive systems, we focus on highest-quality illustrations. Based on interviews with domain experts and a semi-automatic analysis of 202 handmade anatomical drawings, we identify a set of 18 layout quality criteria, naturally not all of equal importance. We design a new geometric label placement algorithm that is based only on the most important criteria. Yet, other criteria can flexibly be included in the algorithm, either as hard constraints not to be violated or as soft constraints whose violation is penalized by a general cost function. We formally prove that our approach yields labelings that satisfy all hard constraints and have minimum overall cost. Introducing several speedup techniques, we further demonstrate how to deploy our approach in practice. In an experimental evaluation on real-world anatomical drawings we show that the resulting labelings are of high quality and can be produced in adequate time.|['Benjamin Niedermann', 'Martin N√∂llenburg', 'Ignaz Rutter']|['cs.CG']

Visibility Graphs are a known optimal algorithm for solving the problem with the use of pre-processing. However, Visibility Graphs are known to perform poorly in terms of running time, especially on large, complex maps. In this paper, we introduce two improvements over the Visibility Graph Algorithm to compute optimal paths. Sparse Visibility Graphs (SVGs) are constructed by pruning unnecessary edges from the original Visibility Graph. Edge N-Level Sparse Visibility Graphs (ENLSVGs) is a hierarchical SVG built by iteratively pruning non-taut paths. We also introduce Line-of-Sight Scans, a faster algorithm for building Visibility Graphs over a grid. SVGs run much faster than Visibility Graphs by reducing the average vertex degree. ENLSVGs, a hierarchical algorithm, improves this further, especially on larger maps. On large maps, with the use of pre-processing, these algorithms are orders of magnitude faster than existing algorithms like Visibility Graphs and Theta*.|['Shunhao Oh', 'Hon Wai Leong']|['cs.CG']

In particular, a k-regret minimizing set has the property that the regret ratio between the score of the top-1 item in Q and the score of the top-k item in P is minimized, where the score of an item is the inner product of the item's attributes with a user's weight (preference) vector.

In the well-studied cooperative, or temperature 2, abstract tile assembly model it is known that there is a tile set to simulate any Turing machine and an intrinsically universal tile set that simulates the shapes and dynamics of any instance of the model, up to spatial rescaling. It has been an open question as to whether the seemingly simpler noncooperative, or temperature 1, model is capable of such behaviour. Here we show that this is not the case, by showing that there is no tile set in the noncooperative model that is intrinsically universal, nor one capable of time-bounded Turing machine simulation within a bounded region of the plane.   Although the noncooperative model intuitively seems to lack the complexity and power of the cooperative model it has been exceedingly hard to prove this. One reason is that there have been few tools to analyse the structure of complicated paths in the plane. This paper provides a number of such tools. A second reason is that almost every obvious and small generalisation to the model (e.g. allowing error, 3D, non-square tiles, signals/wires on tiles, tiles that repel each other, parallel synchronous growth) endows it with great computational, and sometimes simulation, power. Our main results show that all of these generalisations provably increase computational and/or simulation power. Our results hold for both deterministic and nondeterministic noncooperative systems. Our first main result stands in stark contrast with the fact that for both the cooperative tile assembly model, and for 3D noncooperative tile assembly, there are respective intrinsically universal tilesets. Our second main result gives a new technique (reduction to simulation) for proving negative results about computation in tile assembly.|['Pierre-√âtienne Meunier', 'Damien Woods']|['cs.CC', 'cs.CG', 'cs.DS']

We prove that simplifying a planar closed curve with $n$ self-crossings requires $\Theta(n^{3/2})$ homotopy moves in the worst case. Our algorithm improves the best previous upper bound $O(n^2)$, which is already implicit in the classical work of Steinitz; the matching lower bound follows from the construction of closed curves with large defect, a topological invariant of generic closed curves introduced by Aicardi and Arnold. Our lower bound also implies that $\Omega(n^{3/2})$ facial electrical transformations are required to reduce any plane graph with treewidth $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ to a single vertex, matching known upper bounds for rectangular and cylindrical grid graphs. More generally, we prove that transforming one immersion of $k$ circles with at most $n$ self-crossings into another requires $\Theta(n^{3/2} + nk + k^2)$ homotopy moves in the worst case.

Since the seminal paper by Ostrovsky, Rabani, Schulman and Swamy [FOCS 2006], much progress has been made to characterize real-world instances. We distinguish the three main definitions -- Distribution Stability (Awasthi, Blum, Sheffet, FOCS 2010) -- Spectral Separability (Kumar, Kannan, FOCS 2010) -- Perturbation Resilience (Bilu, Linial, ICS 2010) We show that Local Search performs well on the instances with the aforementioned stability properties. Specifically, for the $k$-means and $k$-median objective, we show that Local Search exactly recovers the optimal clustering if the dataset is $3+\varepsilon$-perturbation resilient, and is a PTAS for distribution stability and spectral separability. This implies the first PTAS for instances satisfying the spectral separability condition. For the distribution stability condition we also go beyond previous work by showing that the clustering output by the algorithm and the optimal clustering are very similar. This is a significant step toward understanding the success of Local Search heuristics in clustering applications and supports the legitimacy of the stability conditions: They characterize some of the structure of real-world instances that make Local Search a popular heuristic.|['Vincent Cohen-Addad', 'Chris Schwiegelshohn']|['cs.DS', 'cs.CG', 'cs.LG']

Otherwise, four guards are needed. By extending this example, we show that for every $n$, there is polygon which can be guarded by $3n$ guards with irrational coordinates but need $4n$ guards if the coordinates have to be rational.

We consider LSH for objects that can be represented as point sets in either one or two dimensions. To make the point sets finite size we consider the subset of points on a grid. Directly applying LSH (e.g. min-wise hashing) to these point sets would require time proportional to the number of points. We seek to achieve time that is much lower than direct approaches.   Technically, we introduce new primitives for range-efficient consistent sampling (of independent interest), and show how to turn such samples into LSH values.

Unlike previous work that heuristically specifies particular regularities and defines parametric models, our shape priors are learned directly from existing 3D models under a framework based on affinity propagation. Given a database of 3D models within the same class of objects, we build a comprehensive library of 3D local shape priors. We then formulate the problem to select as-few-as-possible priors from the library, referred to as exemplar priors. These priors are sufficient to represent the 3D shapes of the whole class of objects from where they are generated. By manipulating these priors, we are able to reconstruct geometrically faithful models with the same class of objects from raw point clouds. Our framework can be easily generalized to reconstruct various categories of 3D objects that have more geometrically or topologically complex structures. Comprehensive experiments exhibit the power of our exemplar priors for gracefully solving several problems in 3D shape reconstruction such as preserving sharp features, recovering fine details and so on.|['Oussama Remil', 'Qian Xie', 'Xingyu Xie', 'Kai Xu', 'Jun Wang']|['cs.CG', 'cs.GR']

Existing methods are majorly based on discretization of manifolds as implicit functions, triangle meshes, or point clouds, where the manifold structure is approximated by either zero level set of an implicit function or a set of points. In many applications, manifolds might be only provided as an inter-point distance matrix with possible missing values. This paper discusses a framework to discretize PDEs on manifolds represented as incomplete distance information. Without conducting a time-consuming global coordinates reconstruction, we propose a more efficient strategy by discretizing differential operators only based on point-wisely local reconstruction. Our local reconstruction model is based on the recent advances of low-rank matrix completion theory, where only a very small random portion of distance information is required. This method enables us to conduct analyses of incomplete distance data using solutions of special designed PDEs such as the Laplace-Beltrami (LB) eigen-system. As an application, we demonstrate a new way of manifold reconstruction from an incomplete distance by stitching patches using the spectrum of the LB operator. Intensive numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.|['Rongjie Lai', 'Jia Li']|['math.NA', 'cs.CG', '65D18, 65D25, 65N25']

The approach segments trees iteratively starting from the tallest within a given area to the smallest until all trees have been segmented. To evaluate its performance, the approach was applied to the University of Kentucky Robinson Forest, a deciduous closed-canopy forest with complex terrain and vegetation conditions. The approach identified 94% of dominant and co-dominant trees with a false detection rate of 13%. About 62% of intermediate, overtopped, and dead trees were also detected with a false detection rate of 15%. The overall segmentation accuracy was 77%. Correlations of the segmentation scores of the proposed approach with local terrain and stand metrics was not significant, which is likely an indication of the robustness of the approach as results are not sensitive to the differences in terrain and stand structures.|['Hamid Hamraz', 'Marco A.

We introduce local layering that analyzes the vertical distributions of LiDAR points within their local neighborhoods in order to locally determine the height thresholds for layering the canopy. Unlike the previous work that stripped stiff layers within constrained areas, the local layering method strips flexible (in thickness and elevation) and narrower canopy layers within unconstrained areas. Statistical analyses showed that layering in general strongly improves identifying (specifically under-story) trees for the cost of moderately increasing over-segmentation rate of the identified trees. Combining tree segments across the immediate layers did not seem to improve tree identification accuracy remarkably, suggesting that layers separated canopy layers rather precisely.|['Hamid Hamraz', 'Marco A.

Greedy drawings support a simple geometric routing scheme, in which any node that has to send a packet to a destination ""greedily"" forwards the packet to any neighbor that is closer to the destination than itself, according to the Euclidean distance in the drawing. In a greedy drawing such a neighbor always exists and hence this routing scheme is guaranteed to succeed.   In 2004 Papadimitriou and Ratajczak stated two conjectures related to greedy drawings. The $\textit{greedy embedding conjecture}$ states that every $3$-connected planar graph admits a greedy drawing. The $\textit{convex greedy embedding conjecture}$ asserts that every $3$-connected planar graph admits a planar greedy drawing in which the faces are delimited by convex polygons. In 2008 the greedy embedding conjecture was settled in the positive by Leighton and Moitra.   In this paper we prove that every $3$-connected planar graph admits a $\textit{planar}$ greedy drawing.

For practical applications, linear space is typically imperative. Most previous work in the linear space regime focuses on the case that $c$ exceeds $1$ by a constant term. In a recently accepted paper, optimal bounds have been achieved for any $c>1$ \cite{ALRW17}.   Towards practicality, we present a new and simple data structure using linear space and sublinear query time for any $c>1$ including $c\to 1^+$.

The projected space contains strings which serve as keys for buckets containing the input points. The query algorithm simply projects the query point, then examines points which are assigned to the same or nearby vertices on the Hamming cube. We analyze in detail the query time for some standard LSH families.   To illustrate our claim of practicality, we offer an open-source implementation in {\tt C++}, and report on several experiments in dimension up to 1000 and $n$ up to $10^6$. Our algorithm is one to two orders of magnitude faster than brute force search. Experiments confirm the sublinear dependence on $n$ and the linear dependence on the dimension.

A simple FPRAS is then provided to approximate the desired probability in any dimension. We also study a variant of the CSD problem in which the dominance relation is considered with respect to not only the standard basis but any orthogonal basis of $\mathbb{R}^d$. Specifically, this variant, which we call the {\em free-basis colored stochastic dominance} (FBCSD) problem, considers the probability that a realization of $\mathcal{S}$ contains inter-color dominances with respect to any orthogonal basis of $\mathbb{R}^d$. We show that the CSD problem is polynomial-time reducible to the FBCSD problem in the same dimension, which proves the #P-hardness of the latter for $d \geq 3$.

We investigate two fundamental problems under such a stochastic setting, the closest-pair problem and the nearest-neighbor search. For the former, we study the computation of the $\ell$-threshold probability and the expectation of the closest-pair distance of a realization of $S$. We propose the first algorithm to compute the $\ell$-threshold probability in $O(t+n\log n+ \min\{tn,n^2\})$ time for any given threshold $\ell$, which immediately results in an $O(t+\min\{tn^3,n^4\})$-time algorithm for computing the expected closest-pair distance. Based on this, we further show that one can compute a $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation for the expected closest-pair distance in $O(t+\varepsilon^{-1}\min\{tn^2,n^3\})$ time, by arguing that the expected closest-pair distance can be approximated via $O(\varepsilon^{-1}n)$ threshold probability queries.

Recent work typically represents a 3D shape as a set of binary variables corresponding to 3D voxels of a uniform 3D grid centered on the shape, and resorts to deep convolutional neural networks(CNNs) for modeling these binary variables. Robust learning of such CNNs is currently limited by the small datasets of 3D shapes available, an order of magnitude smaller than other common datasets in computer vision. Related work typically deals with the small training datasets using a number of ad hoc, hand-tuning strategies. To address this issue, we formulate CNN learning as a beam search aimed at identifying an optimal CNN architecture, namely, the number of layers, nodes, and their connectivity in the network, as well as estimating parameters of such an optimal CNN. Each state of the beam search corresponds to a candidate CNN. Two types of actions are defined to add new convolutional filters or new convolutional layers to a parent CNN, and thus transition to children states. The utility function of each action is efficiently computed by transferring parameter values of the parent CNN to its children, thereby enabling an efficient beam search. Our experimental evaluation on the 3D ModelNet dataset demonstrates that our model pursuit using the beam search yields a CNN with superior performance on 3D shape classification than the state of the art.|['Xu Xu', 'Sinisa Todorovic']|['cs.CV', 'cs.CG']

While classical approaches suffer from the curse of dimensionality, locality sensitive hashing (LSH) can effectively solve a-approximate r-near neighbor problem, and has been proven to be optimal in the worst case. However, for real-world data sets, LSH can naturally benefit from well-dispersed data and low doubling dimension, leading to significantly improved performance. In this paper, we address this issue and propose a refined analyses for running time of approximating near neighbors queries via LSH. We characterize dispersion of data using N_b, the number of b*r-near pairs among the data points. Combined with optimal data-oblivious LSH scheme, we get a new query time bound depending on N_b and doubling dimension. For many natural scenarios where points are well-dispersed or lying in a low-doubling-dimension space, our result leads to sharper performance than existing worst-case analysis. This paper not only present first rigorous proof on how LSHs make use of the structure of data points, but also provide important insights into parameter setting in the practice of LSH beyond worst case. Besides, the techniques in our analysis involve a generalized version of sphere packing problem, which might be of some independent interest.|['Wenlong Mou', 'Liwei Wang']|['cs.DS', 'cs.CG']

A major open problem is to devise a constructive version of Banaszczyk's vector balancing theorem, i.e. to find an efficient algorithm which constructs the signed combination.   We make progress towards this goal along several fronts. As our first contribution, we show an equivalence between Banaszczyk's theorem and the existence of $O(1)$-subgaussian distributions over signed combinations. For the case of symmetric convex bodies, our equivalence implies the existence of a universal signing algorithm (i.e. independent of the body), which simply samples from the subgaussian sign distribution and checks to see if the associated combination lands inside the body. For asymmetric convex bodies, we provide a novel recentering procedure, which allows us to reduce to the case where the body is symmetric.   As our second main contribution, we show that the above framework can be efficiently implemented when the vectors have length $O(1/\sqrt{\log n})$, recovering Banaszczyk's results under this stronger assumption. More precisely, we use random walk techniques to produce the required $O(1)$-subgaussian signing distributions when the vectors have length $O(1/\sqrt{\log n})$, and use a stochastic gradient ascent method to implement the recentering procedure for asymmetric bodies.|['Daniel Dadush', 'Shashwat Garg', 'Shachar Lovett', 'Aleksandar Nikolov']|['cs.DS', 'cs.CG', 'math.FA', 'math.PR']

There are only very few graph classes for which the exact crossing number is known or for which there at least exist constant approximation ratios. Furthermore, up to now, general crossing number computations have never been successfully tackled using bounded width of graph decompositions, like treewidth or pathwidth.   In this paper, we for the first time show that crossing number is tractable (even in linear time) for maximal graphs of bounded pathwidth~3. The technique also shows that the crossing number and the rectilinear (a.k.a. straight-line) crossing number are identical for this graph class, and that we require only an $O(n)\times O(n)$-grid to achieve such a drawing.   Our techniques can further be extended to devise a 2-approximation for general graphs with pathwidth 3, and a $4w^3$-approximation for maximal graphs of pathwidth $w$. This is a constant approximation for bounded pathwidth graphs.|['Therese Biedl', 'Markus Chimani', 'Martin Derka', 'Petra Mutzel']|['cs.CG']

In particular, we show that: (1) intersection graphs of grounded segments and intersection graphs of downward rays form the same graph class, (2) not every intersection graph of rays is an intersection graph of downward rays, and (3) not every intersection graph of rays is an outer segment graph. The first result answers an open problem posed by Cabello and Jej\v{c}i\v{c}. The third result confirms a conjecture by Cabello. We thereby completely elucidate the remaining open questions on the containment relations between these classes of segment graphs. We further characterize the complexity of the recognition problems for the classes of outer segment, grounded segment, and ray intersection graphs. We prove that these recognition problems are complete for the existential theory of the reals.

The module provides the self-contained, parallel grid manager, as well as the underlying elementary curvilinear geometry module dune-curvilineargeometry. This work is motivated by the need for reliable and scalable electromagnetic design of nanooptical devices. Curvilinear geometries improve both the accuracy of modeling smooth material boundaries, and the h/p-convergence rate of PDE solutions, reducing the necessary computational effort. dune-curvilineargrid provides a large spectrum of features for scalable parallel implementations of Finite Element and Boundary Integral methods over curvilinear tetrahedral geometries, including symbolic polynomial mappings and operations, recursive integration, sparse and dense grid communication, parallel timing and memory footprint diagnostics utilities. It is written in templated C++ using MPI for parallelization and ParMETIS for grid partitioning, and is provided as a module for the DUNE interface. The dune-curvilineargrid grid manager is continuously developed and improved, and so is this documentation.

Voronoi diagrams and Delaunay complexes can be defined for arbitrary Riemannian manifolds. However, Delaunay's genericity assumption no longer guarantees that the Delaunay complex will yield a triangulation; stronger assumptions on $P$ are required. A natural one is to assume that $P$ is sufficiently dense. Although results in this direction have been claimed, we show that sample density alone is insufficient to ensure that the Delaunay complex triangulates a manifold of dimension greater than 2.|['Jean-Daniel Boissonnat', 'Ramsay Dyer', 'Arijit Ghosh', 'Nikolay Martynchuk']|['cs.CG', 'math.DG', 'math.GT', '57R05 (Primary), 54B15, 53B20 (Secondary)']

The resulting projective coordinates provide a multi-scale representation of the data, and capture low dimensional underlying topological features. An initial map is obtained in two steps: First, the persistent cohomology of a sparse filtration is used to compute systems of transition functions for (real and complex) line bundles over neighborhoods of the data. Next, the transition functions are used to produce explicit classifying maps for the induced bundles. A framework for dimensionality reduction in projective space (Principal Projective Components) is also developed, aimed at decreasing the target dimension of the original map.

We introduce the wave method for approximating geodesic distances from a point on a manifold mesh. Our method involves the solution of two linear systems of equations. One system of equations is solved repeatedly to propagate the wave on the entire mesh, and one system is solved once after wave propagation is complete in order to compute the approximate geodesic distances up to an additive constant. However, these systems need to be pre-factored only once, and can be solved efficiently at each iteration. All of our tests required approximately between 300 and 400 iterations, which were completed in a few seconds. Therefore, this method can approximate geodesic distances quickly, and the approximation is highly accurate.|['Ayushi Sinha', 'Michael Kazhdan']|['cs.CG', 'cs.GR', 'I.3.5']

In this paper we study the construction of CDSs in higher dimensions.   We show that any total order can be used to create a set of {\em consistent digital rays} CDR in $\mathbb{Z}^d$ (a set of rays emanating from a fixed point $p$ that satisfies the extension of the Euclidean axioms). We fully characterize for which total orders the construction holds and study their Hausdorff distance, which in particular positively answers the question posed by Christ {\em et al.}.|['Man-Kwun Chiu', 'Matias Korman']|['cs.CG', 'I.3.5; I.4.1']

We consider a graph augmentation problem on $C$, where we want to place $k\geq 1$ \emph{shortcuts} on $C$ such that the diameter of the resulting graph is minimized.   We analyze for each $k$ with $1\leq k\leq 7$ what the optimal set of shortcuts is. Interestingly, the minimum diameter one can obtain is not a strictly decreasing function of~$k$. For example, with seven shortcuts one cannot obtain a smaller diameter than with six shortcuts. Finally, we prove that the optimal diameter is $2 + \Theta(1/k^{\frac{2}{3}})$ for any~$k$.|['Sang Won Bae', 'Mark de Berg', 'Otfried Cheong', 'Joachim Gudmundsson', 'Christos Levcopoulos']|['math.MG', 'cs.CG']
