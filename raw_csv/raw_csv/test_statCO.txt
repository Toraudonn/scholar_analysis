In particular, the method can be used to estimate expectations with respect to a target probability distribution over an infinite-dimensional and non-compact space as given, for example, by a Bayesian inverse problem with Gaussian random field prior. Under suitable assumptions the MLSMC method has the optimal $O(\epsilon^{-2})$ bound on the cost to obtain a mean-square error of $O(\epsilon^2)$. The algorithm is accelerated by dimension-independent likelihood-informed (DILI) proposals designed for Gaussian priors, leveraging a novel variation which uses empirical sample covariance information in lieu of Hessian information, hence eliminating the requirement for gradient evaluations. The efficiency of the algorithm is illustrated on two examples: inversion of noisy pressure measurements in a PDE model of Darcy flow to recover the posterior distribution of the permeability field, and inversion of noisy measurements of the solution of an SDE to recover the posterior path measure.|['Alexandros Beskos', 'Ajay Jasra', 'Kody Law', 'Youssef Marzouk', 'Yan Zhou']|['stat.CO']

In such cases, inaccuracies of the applied inference methods will result in noisy outputs. In this study, we propose a novel approach for causal inference when one or more key variables are noisy.

This allows for quickly sampling from a broad class of stochastic blockmodel graphs (degree-corrected, mixed membership, overlapping) all of which are specific parameterizations of the generalized random product graph model defined in Section 2.2. The basic idea of fastRG is to first sample the number of edges $m$ and then sample each edge. The key insight is that because of the the low rank expectation, it is easy to sample individual edges. The naive ""element-wise"" algorithm requires $O(n^2)$ operations to generate the $n\times n$ adjacency matrix $A$. In sparse graphs, where $m = O(n)$, ignoring log terms, fastRG runs in time $O(n)$. An implementation in fastRG is available on github. A computational experiment in Section 2.4 simulates graphs up to $n=10,000,000$ nodes with $m = 100,000,000$ edges.

Therefore, this paper describes the use of Student's t distribution to develop robust, scalable, and simple filtering and smoothing algorithms.   After a discussion of Student's t distribution, exact filtering in linear state-space models with t noise is analyzed. Intermediate approximation steps are used to arrive at filtering and smoothing algorithms that closely resemble the KF and the Rauch-Tung-Striebel (RTS) smoother except for a nonlinear measurement-dependent matrix update. The required approximations are discussed and an undesirable behavior of moment matching for t densities is revealed. A favorable approximation based on minimization of the Kullback-Leibler divergence is presented. Because of its relation to the KF, some properties and algorithmic extensions are inherited by the t filter.

There is no closed-form solution available for this problem, implying that we are forced to use approximations. In this tutorial we will provide a self-contained introduction to one of the state-of-the-art methods---the particle Metropolis-Hastings algorithm---which has proven to offer very practical approximations. This is a Monte Carlo based method, where the so-called particle filter is used to guide a Markov chain Monte Carlo method through the parameter space. One of the key merits of the particle Metropolis-Hastings method is that it is guaranteed to converge to the ""true solution"" under mild assumptions, despite being based on a practical implementation of a particle filter (i.e., using a finite number of particles). We will also provide a motivating numerical example illustrating the method which we have implemented in an in-house developed modeling language, serving the purpose of abstracting away the underlying mathematics of the Monte Carlo approximations from the user.

One of the main disadvantages of ABC in practical situations, however, is that parameter inference must generally rely on summary statistics of the data. This is particularly the case for problems involving high-dimensional data, such as biological imaging experiments. However, some summary statistics contain more information about parameters of interest than others, and it is not always clear how to weight their contributions within the ABC framework. We address this problem by developing an automatic, adaptive algorithm that chooses weights for each summary statistic. Our algorithm aims to maximize the distance between the prior and the approximate posterior by automatically adapting the weights within the ABC distance function. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm, we apply it to several stochastic models of biochemical reaction networks, and a spatial model of diffusion, and compare our results with existing algorithms.|['Jonathan U Harrison', 'Ruth E Baker']|['stat.CO']

The ability of an MS algorithm to obtain the modes of its KDE depends on whether or not the fixed-point scheme converges. The convergence of MS algorithms have recently been proved under some general conditions via first principle arguments. We complement the recent proofs by demonstrating that the MS algorithm operating on a Gaussian KDE can be viewed as an MM (minorization-maximization) algorithm, and thus permits the application of convergence techniques for such constructions. For the Gaussian case, we extend upon the previously results by showing that the fixed-points of the MS algorithm are all stationary points of the KDE in cases where the stationary points may not necessarily be isolated.|['Hien D Nguyen']|['stat.CO']

The second approach consists in maximizing the MICL, which considers the clustering task, with an algorithm of alternate optimization. This approach performs model selection without requiring the maximum likelihood estimates for model comparison, then parameter inference is done for the unique selected model. Thus, the benefits of both approaches is to avoid the computation of the maximum likelihood estimates for each model comparison. Moreover, they also avoid the use of the standard algorithms for variable selection which are often suboptimal (e.g. stepwise method) and computationally expensive.

Typically, only one of the latter is optimized for the sake of constructing a well behaved estimator of the low-dimensional parameter of interest. Optimizing more than one of them for the sake of achieving a better bias-variance trade-off in the estimation of the parameter of interest is the core idea driving the general template of the collaborative targeted minimum loss-based estimation (C-TMLE) procedure. The original implementation/instantiation of the C-TMLE template can be presented as a greedy forward stepwise C-TMLE algorithm. It does not scale well when the number $p$ of covariates increases drastically. This motivates the introduction of a novel instantiation of the C-TMLE template where the covariates are pre-ordered. Its time complexity is $\mathcal{O}(p)$ as opposed to the original $\mathcal{O}(p^2)$, a remarkable gain. We propose two pre-ordering strategies and suggest a rule of thumb to develop other meaningful strategies. Because it is usually unclear a priori which pre-ordering strategy to choose, we also introduce another implementation/instantiation called SL-C-TMLE algorithm that enables the data-driven choice of the better pre-ordering strategy given the problem at hand. Its time complexity is $\mathcal{O}(p)$ as well. The computational burden and relative performance of these algorithms were compared in simulation studies involving fully synthetic data or partially synthetic data based on a real world large electronic health database; and in analyses of three real, large electronic health databases.

This methodology has been implemented in the R-INLA package which permits INLA to be used from within R statistical software. Although INLA is implemented as a general methodology, its use in practice is limited to the models implemented in the R-INLA package.   Spatial autoregressive models are widely used in spatial econometrics but have until now been missing from the R-INLA package. In this paper, we describe the implementation and application of a new class of latent models in INLA made available through R-INLA. This new latent class implements a standard spatial lag model, which is widely used and that can be used to build more complex models in spatial econometrics.   The implementation of this latent model in R-INLA also means that all the other features of INLA can be used for model fitting, model selection and inference in spatial econometrics, as will be shown in this paper. Finally, we will illustrate the use of this new latent model and its applications with two datasets based on Gaussian and binary outcomes.|['Virgilio Gomez-Rubio', 'Roger S.

We consider DP Bayesian learning in a distributed setting, where each party only holds a single sample or a few samples of the data. We propose a novel method for DP learning in this distributed setting, based on a secure multi-party sum function for aggregating summaries from the data holders. Each data holder adds their share of Gaussian noise to make the total computation differentially private using the Gaussian mechanism. We prove that the system can be made secure against a desired number of colluding data owners and robust against faulting data owners.

For those aiming at inferring certain quantities of interest (QoI), it is desirable to explore the dependency between sensor measurements and QoI. One of the most popular metric for the dependency is mutual information which naturally measures how much information about one variable can be obtained given the other. However, computing mutual information is always challenging, and the result is unreliable in high dimension. In this paper, we propose an approach to find an approximate lower bound of mutual information and compute it in a lower dimension. Then, sensors are placed where highest mutual information (lower bound) is achieved and QoI is inferred via Bayes rule given sensor measurements. In addition, Bayesian optimization is introduced to provide a continuous mutual information surface over the domain and thus reduce the number of evaluations. A chemical release accident is simulated where multiple sensors are placed to locate the source of the release. The result shows that the proposed approach is both effective and efficient in inferring QoI.|['Xiao Lin', 'Asif Chowdhury', 'Xiaofan Wang', 'Gabriel Terejanu']|['stat.CO']

They combine the idea of implicit densities with hierarchical Bayesian modeling and deep neural networks. The use of implicit models with Bayesian analysis has been limited by our ability to perform accurate and scalable inference. We develop likelihood-free variational inference (LFVI). Key to LFVI is specifying a variational family that is also implicit. This matches the model's flexibility and allows for accurate approximation of the posterior. Our work scales up implicit models to sizes previously not possible and advances their modeling design.

One way to do so is through compositional models, which are formed by combining blocks consisting of simpler models. One can increase the complexity of the compositional model by either stacking more blocks or by using a not-so-simple model as a building block. This thesis is an example of the latter. One first aim is to expand the choice of Bayesian nonparametric (BNP) blocks for constructing tractable compositional models. So far, most of the models that have a Bayesian nonparametric component use a Dirichlet Process or a Pitman-Yor process because of the availability of tractable and compact representations. This thesis shows how to overcome certain intractabilities in order to obtain analogous compact representations for the class of Poisson-Kingman priors which includes the Dirichlet and Pitman-Yor processes.   A major impediment to the widespread use of Bayesian nonparametric building blocks is that inference is often costly, intractable or difficult to carry out. This is an active research area since dealing with the model's infinite dimensional component forbids the direct use of standard simulation-based methods. The main contribution of this thesis is a variety of inference schemes that tackle this problem: Markov chain Monte Carlo and Sequential Monte Carlo methods, which are exact inference schemes since they target the true posterior. The contributions of this thesis, in a larger context, provide general purpose exact inference schemes in the flavour or probabilistic programming: the user is able to choose from a variety of models, focusing only on the modelling part. Indeed, if the wide enough class of Poisson-Kingman priors is used as one of our blocks, this objective is achieved.|['Maria Lomeli']|['stat.CO']

The standard method to assess the water quality of a catchment, or a group of catchments, usually involves collecting point measurements of water quality and other additional information such as the date and time of measurements, rainfall amounts, the land-use and soil-type of the catchment and the elevation. Some of this auxiliary information will be point data, measured at the exact location, whereas other such as land-use will be areal data often in a compositional format. Two problems arise if analysts try to incorporate this information into a statistical model in order to predict (for example) the influence of land-use on water quality. First is the spatial change of support problem that arises when using areal data to predict outcomes at point locations. Secondly, the physical process driving water quality is not compositional, rather it is the observation process that provides compositional data. In this paper we present an approach that accounts for these two issues by using a latent variable to identify the land-use that most likely influences water quality. This latent variable is used in a spatial mixture model to help estimate the influence of land-use on water quality. We demonstrate the potential of this approach with data from a water quality research study in the Mount Lofty range, in South Australia.|['Adrien Ickowicz', 'Jessica H. Ford', 'Keith R.

However, genomic-scale networks are high-dimensional models and are usually estimated from a relatively small number of samples. Therefore, their usefulness is hampered by estimation instability. In addition, the complexity of the models is controlled by one or more penalization (tuning) parameters where small changes to these can lead to vastly different networks, thus making interpretation of models difficult. This necessitates the development of techniques to produce robust network models accompanied by estimation quality assessments.   We introduce Resampling of Penalized Estimates (ROPE): a novel statistical method for robust network modeling. The method utilizes resampling-based network estimation and integrates results from several levels of penalization through a constrained, over-dispersed beta-binomial mixture model. ROPE provides robust False Discovery Rate (FDR) control of network estimates and each edge is assigned a measure of validity, the q-value, corresponding to the FDR-level for which the edge would be included in the network model. We apply ROPE to several simulated data sets as well as genomic data from The Cancer Genome Atlas. We show that ROPE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of FDR control and robust performance across data sets.

We propose an alternative, termed the horseshoe regularization penalty for feature subset selection, and demonstrate its theoretical and computational advantages. The distinguishing feature from existing non-convex optimization approaches is a full probabilistic representation of the penalty as the negative of the logarithm of a suitable prior, which in turn enables an efficient expectation-maximization algorithm for optimization and MCMC for uncertainty quantification.

When data are stored across multiple machines, however, communication cost can prohibit the computation of PCA in a central location and distributed algorithms for PCA are thus needed. This paper proposes and studies a distributed PCA algorithm: each node machine computes the top $K$ eigenvectors and transmits them to the central server; the central server then aggregates the information from all the node machines and conducts a PCA based on the aggregated information. We investigate the bias and variance for the resulting distributed estimator of the top $K$ eigenvectors. In particular, we show that for distributions with symmetric innovation, the distributed PCA is ""unbiased"". We derive the rate of convergence for distributed PCA estimators, which depends explicitly on the effective rank of covariance, eigen-gap, and the number of machines. We show that when the number of machines is not unreasonably large, the distributed PCA performs as well as the whole sample PCA, even without full access of whole data. The theoretical results are verified by an extensive simulation study. We also extend our analysis to the heterogeneous case where the population covariance matrices are different across local machines but share similar top eigen-structures."|['Jianqing Fan', 'Dong Wang', 'Kaizheng Wang', 'Ziwei Zhu']|['stat.CO', 'math.ST', 'stat.TH']

With advances in technologies, it has become common to record from hundreds of neurons simultaneously, and this number is growing quickly, so that the number of pairwise tests can be very large. It is important to control the rate at which false positives occur. In addition, there is sometimes information that affects the probability of a positive result for any given pair. In the case of neurons, they are more likely to have correlated activity when they are close together, and when they respond similarly to various stimuli. Recently a method was developed to control false positives when covariate information, such as distances between pairs of neurons, is available. This method, however, relies on computationally-intensive Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Here we develop an alternative, based on Sequential Monte Carlo, which scales well with the size of the dataset. This scheme considers data items sequentially, with relevant probabilities being updated at each step. Simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm delivers results as accurately as the previous MCMC method with only a single pass through the data. We illustrate the method by using it to analyze neural recordings from extrastriate cortex in a macaque monkey.

Using such models inside a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm requires repeatedly simulating random fields. This is a nontrivial issue, especially when the full conditional precision matrix depends on parameters that change at each iteration. Typically in Bayesian computation, GMRFs are updated jointly in a block Gibbs sampler or one location at a time in a single-site sampler. The former approach leads to quicker convergence by updating correlated variables all at once, while the latter avoids solving large matrices. Efficient algorithms for sampling Markov random fields have become the focus of much recent research in the machine learning literature, much of which can be useful to statisticians. We briefly review recently proposed approaches with an eye toward implementation for statisticians without expertise in numerical analysis or advanced computing. In particular, we consider a version of block sampling in which the underlying graph can be cut so that conditionally independent sites are all updated together. This algorithm allows a practitioner to parallelize the updating of a subset locations or to take advantage of `vectorized' calculations in a high-level language such as R. Through both simulation and real data application, we demonstrate computational savings that can be achieved versus both traditional single-site updating and block updating, regardless of whether the data are on a regular or irregular lattice. We argue that this easily-implemented sampling routine provides a good compromise between statistical and computational efficiency when working with large datasets.|['D.

Model-based boosting is a tool to fit a statistical model while performing variable selection at the same time. A drawback of the fitting lies in the need of multiple model fits on slightly altered data (e.g. cross-validation or bootstrap) to find the optimal number of boosting iterations and prevent overfitting. In our proposed approach, we augment the data set with randomly permuted versions of the true variables, so called shadow variables, and stop the step-wise fitting as soon as such a variable would be added to the model. This allows variable selection in a single fit of the model without requiring further parameter tuning.

In addition, its implementation in the R-INLA package for the R statistical software provides an easy way to fit models using INLA in practice. R-INLA implements a number of widely used latent models, including several spatial models. In addition, R-INLA can fit models in a fraction of the time than other computer intensive methods (e.g. Markov Chain Monte Carlo) take to fit the same model.   Although INLA provides a fast approximation to the marginals of the model parameters, it is difficult to use it with models not implemented in R-INLA. It is also difficult to make multivariate posterior inference on the parameters of the model as INLA focuses on the posterior marginals and not the joint posterior distribution.   In this paper we describe how to use INLA within the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to fit spatial models and estimate the joint posterior distribution of a reduced number of parameters. We will illustrate the benefits of this new method with two examples on spatial econometrics and disease mapping where complex spatial models with several spatial structures need to be fitted.|['Virgilio Gómez-Rubio', 'Francisco Palmí-Perales']|['stat.CO']

In this paper we tackle the theoretical analysis of the recently proposed {\it nonlinear} population Monte Carlo (NPMC). This is an iterative importance sampling scheme whose key features, compared to conventional importance samplers, are (i) the approximate computation of the importance weights (IWs) assigned to the Monte Carlo samples and (ii) the nonlinear transformation of these IWs in order to prevent the degeneracy problem that flaws the performance of conventional importance samplers. The contribution of the present paper is a rigorous proof of convergence of the nonlinear IS (NIS) scheme as the number of Monte Carlo samples, $M$, increases. Our analysis reveals that the NIS approximation errors converge to 0 almost surely and with the optimal Monte Carlo rate of $M^{-\frac{1}{2}}$. Moreover, we prove that this is achieved even when the mean estimation error of the IWs remains constant, a property that has been termed {\it exact approximation} in the Markov chain Monte Carlo literature.

Recent advances in Monte Carlo based methods have made previously intractable problem possible to solve using only the computational power available in a standard personal computer. For probabilistic learning of unknown parameters in nonlinear state-space models, methods based on the particle filter have proven useful. However, a notoriously challenging problem occurs when the observations are highly informative, i.e. when there is very little or no measurement noise present. The particle filter will then struggle in estimating one of the basic component in most parameter learning algorithms, the likelihood p(data parameters). To this end we suggest an algorithm which initially assumes that there is artificial measurement noise present. The variance of this noise is sequentially decreased in an adaptive fashion such that we in the end recover the original problem or possibly a very close approximation of it. Computationally the parameters are learned using a sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) sampler, which gives our proposed method a clear resemblance to the SMC^2 method. Another natural link is also made to the ideas underlying the so-called approximate Bayesian computation (ABC). We provide a theoretical justification (implying convergence results) for the suggested approach.

Specifically, the idea of using heat diffusion on a hypersphere to measure similarity has been proposed and tested by \citet{Lafferty:2015uy}, demonstrating promising results based on an approximate heat kernel, however, the exact hyperspherical heat kernel hitherto remains unknown. In this paper, we derive an exact form of the heat kernel on a unit hypersphere in terms of a uniformly and absolutely convergent series in high-dimensional angular momentum eigenmodes. Being a natural measure of similarity between sample points dwelling on a hypersphere, the exact kernel often shows superior performance in kernel SVM classifications applied to text mining, tumor somatic mutation imputation, and stock market analysis.

Thus, in this work, we numerically demonstrate and mathematically argue that stalling is a crippling and generic limitation of SGD and its variants in practice. Once we have established the problem of stalling, we generalize an existing framework for hedging against its effects, which (1) deters SGD and its variants from stalling, (2) still provides convergence guarantees, and (3) makes SGD and its variants more practical methods for minimization.|['Vivak Patel']|['stat.ML', 'cs.LG', 'math.OC', 'stat.CO', '62L20, 62L12, 90C99', 'G.1.6; G.3; I.2.6']

This model assumes that there is an underlying latent space in which the actors follow a finite mixture distribution. Moreover, actors which are close in this latent space are more likely to be tied by an edge. This is an appealing approach since it allows the model to cluster actors which consequently provides the practitioner with useful qualitative information. However, exploring the uncertainty in the number of underlying latent components in the mixture distribution is a complex task. The current state-of-the-art is to use an approximate form of BIC for this purpose, where an approximation of the log-likelihood is used instead of the true log-likelihood which is unavailable. The main contribution of this paper is to show that through the use of conjugate prior distributions it is possible to analytically integrate out almost all of the model parameters, leaving a posterior distribution which depends on the allocation vector of the mixture model. This enables posterior inference over the number of components in the latent mixture distribution without using trans- dimensional MCMC algorithms such as reversible jump MCMC. Our approach is compared with the state-of-the-art latentnet (Krivitsky & Handcock 2015) and VBLPCM (Salter-Townshend & Murphy 2013) packages.|['Caitriona Ryan', 'Jason Wyse', 'Nial Friel']|['stat.CO']

This approach to evaluate ALD is based on purely non-parametric considerations, i.e., based on the empirical CFs of frequency and severity of the claims in the actuarial risk applications. This approach can be, however, naturally generalized to a more complex semi-parametric modeling approach, e.g., by incorporating the generalized Pareto distribution fit of the severity distribution heavy tails, and/or by considering the weighted mixture of the parametric CFs (used to model the expert knowledge) and the empirical CFs (used to incorporate the knowledge based on the historical data - internal and/or external). Here we present a simple and yet efficient method and algorithms for numerical inversion of the CF, suitable for evaluation of the ALDs and the associated measures of interest important for applications, as, e.g., the value at risk (VaR). The presented approach is based on combination of the Gil-Pelaez inversion formulae for deriving the probability distribution (PDF and CDF) from the compound (empirical) CF and the trapezoidal rule used for numerical integration.

INLA is based on producing an accurate approximation to the posterior marginal distributions of the parameters in the model and some other quantities of interest by using repeated approximations to intermediate distributions and integrals that appear in the computation of the posterior marginals.   INLA focuses on models whose latent effects are a Gaussian Markov random field (GMRF). For this reason, we have explored alternative ways of expanding the number of possible models that can be fitted using the INLA methodology. In this paper, we present a novel approach that combines INLA and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). The aim is to consider a wider range of models that cannot be fitted with INLA unless some of the parameters of the model have been fixed. Hence, conditioning on these parameters the model could be fitted with the R-INLA package. We show how new values of these parameters can be drawn from their posterior by using conditional models fitted with INLA and standard MCMC algorithms, such as Metropolis-Hastings. Hence, this will extend the use of INLA to fit models that can be expressed as a conditional LGM. Also, this new approach can be used to build simpler MCMC samplers for complex models as it allows sampling only on a limited number parameters in the model.   We will demonstrate how our approach can extend the class of models that could benefit from INLA, and how the R-INLA package will ease its implementation. We will go through simple examples of this new approach before we discuss more advanced problems with datasets taken from relevant literature.|['Virgilio Gómez-Rubio', 'Håvard Rue']|['stat.CO']

We construct kernel density estimates of the sampling distributions based on simulated data, and show that the resulting hypothesis test dramatically improves on the statistical power of a current state-of-the-art method. A key reason for this improvement is the use of multi-locus data, in particular averaging observed site frequency spectra across unlinked loci to reduce sampling variance.

This adjustment often occurs through a Brownian diffusion process along the branches of the phylogeny that generates model residuals or the traits themselves. For high-dimensional traits, inferring all pair-wise correlations within the multivariate diffusion is limiting. To circumvent this problem, we propose phylogenetic factor analysis (PFA) that assumes a small unknown number of independent evolutionary factors arise along the phylogeny and these factors generate clusters of dependent traits. Set in a Bayesian framework, PFA provides measures of uncertainty on the factor number and groupings, combines both continuous and discrete traits, integrates over missing measurements and incorporates phylogenetic uncertainty with the help of molecular sequences. We develop Gibbs samplers based on dynamic programming to estimate the PFA posterior distribution, over three-fold faster than for multivariate diffusion and a further order-of-magnitude more efficiently in the presence of latent traits. We further propose a novel marginal likelihood estimator for previously impractical models with discrete data and find that PFA also provides a better fit than multivariate diffusion in evolutionary questions in columbine flower development, placental reproduction transitions and triggerfish fin morphometry.|['Max R.

The utility of such a method is that, for a prescribed level of mean square error, the cost of this MLMC method is provably less than i.i.d. sampling from the posterior associated to the most precise discretization.

Thanks to recent advances in numerical transport, the computation of these distances has become feasible, up to controllable approximation errors. We leverage these advances to propose point estimators and quasi-Bayesian distributions for parameter inference, first for independent data. For dependent data, we extend the approach by using delay reconstruction and residual reconstruction techniques. For large data sets, we propose an alternative distance using the Hilbert space-filling curve, which computation scales as $n\log n$ where $n$ is the size of the data.

The approach is a computational algorithm motivated from the KKT conditions for the $\ell_0$-penalized least squares solutions. It generates a sequence of solutions iteratively, based on support detection using primal and dual information and root finding. We refer to the algorithm as SDAR for brevity. Under a sparse Rieze condition on the design matrix and certain other conditions, we show that with high probability, the $\ell_2$ estimation error of the solution sequence decays exponentially to the minimax error bound in $O(\sqrt{J}\log(R))$ steps; and under a mutual coherence condition and certain other conditions, the $\ell_{\infty}$ estimation error decays to the optimal error bound in $O(\log(R))$ steps, where $J$ is the number of important predictors, $R$ is the relative magnitude of the nonzero target coefficients. Computational complexity analysis shows that the cost of SDAR is $O(np)$ per iteration. Moreover the oracle least squares estimator can be exactly recovered with high probability at the same cost if we know the sparsity level. We also consider an adaptive version of SDAR to make it more practical in applications.

In this paper, we take advantage of this in order to construct efficient sampling algorithms based on the Lie-Trotter decomposition of a nonreversible diffusion process into reversible and nonreversible components. We show that samplers based on this scheme can significantly outperform standard MCMC methods, at the cost of introducing some controlled bias. In particular, we prove that numerical integrators constructed according to this decomposition are geometrically ergodic and characterise fully their asymptotic bias and variance, showing that the sampler inherits the good mixing properties of the underlying nonreversible diffusion.

In many variants of the option valuation problem, a closed form solution cannot be obtained and computational methods are needed. The cost to exactly compute expected values over random paths grows exponentially in the depth of the tree, rendering a serial computation of one branch at a time impractical. We propose a parallelization method that transforms the calculation of the expected value into an ""embarrassingly parallel"" problem by mapping the branches of the binomial tree to the processes in a multiprocessor computing environment. We also propose a parallel Monte Carlo method which takes advantage of the mapping to achieve a reduced variance over the basic Monte Carlo estimator.

A specific type of differential expression is differential transcript usage (DTU) and targets changes in the relative within gene expression of a transcript. The contribution of this paper is to: (a) extend the use of cjBitSeq to the DTU context, a previously introduced Bayesian model which is originally designed for identifying changes in overall expression levels and (b) propose a Bayesian version of DRIMSeq, a frequentist model for inferring DTU. cjBitSeq is a read based model and performs fully Bayesian inference by MCMC sampling on the space of latent state of each transcript per gene. BayesDRIMSeq is a count based model and estimates the Bayes Factor of a DTU model against a null model using Laplace's approximation. The proposed models are benchmarked against the existing ones using a recent independent simulation study. Our results suggest that the Bayesian methods exhibit similar performance with DRIMSeq in terms of precision/recall but offer better calibration of False Discovery Rate.|['Panagiotis Papastamoulis', 'Magnus Rattray']|['q-bio.GN', 'stat.AP', 'stat.CO']

Bayesian nonparametric dependent mixture models provide a useful approach to flexibly address this goal, however many representations are characterized by difficult interpretation and intractable computational methods. Motivated by these issues, we describe a flexible formulation for Bayesian density regression, which is defined as a potentially infinite mixture model whose probability weights change with the covariates via a stick-breaking construction relying on a set of logistic regressions. We derive theoretical properties and show that our logit stick-breaking representation can be interpreted as a simple continuation-ratio logistic regression. This result facilitates derivation of three computational methods of routine use in Bayesian inference, covering Markov Chain Monte Carlo via Gibbs sampling, the Expectation Conditional Maximization algorithm for the estimation of posterior modes, and a Variational Bayes approach for scalable inference. The algorithms associated with these methods are analytically derived and made available online at https://github.com/tommasorigon/DLSBP. We additionally compare the three computational strategies in an application to the Old Faithful Geyser dataset.|['Tommaso Rigon', 'Daniele Durante']|['stat.CO']

Magnus expansions, time-varying rates, and pseudospectra are highlighted. Exact eigenvalues are found and contrasted with the large errors produced by standard numerical methods in some cases. Isomerisation provides a running example and an illustrative application to chemical kinetics.

The iterative algorithm we propose, MEBoost, follows a path defined by estimating equations that correct for covariate measurement error. Via simulation, we evaluated our method and compare its performance to the recently-proposed Convex Conditioned Lasso (CoCoLasso) and to the ""naive"" Lasso which does not correct for measurement error. Increasing the degree of measurement error increased prediction error and decreased the probability of accurate covariate selection, but this loss of accuracy was least pronounced when using MEBoost. We illustrate the use of MEBoost in practice by analyzing data from the Box Lunch Study, a clinical trial in nutrition where several variables are based on self-report and hence measured with error."|['Benjamin Brown', 'Timothy Weaver', 'Julian Wolfson']|['stat.CO', 'stat.ML']
