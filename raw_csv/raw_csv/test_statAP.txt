Taking images as responses, the task raises a lot of challenges due to the high dimensionality of the image with relatively small number of samples, as well as the noisiness of measurements in medical images.   In this paper we propose a novel method {\it Smooth Image-on-scalar Regression} (SIR) for recovering the true association between an image outcome and scalar predictors. The estimator is achieved by minimizing a mean squared error with a total variation (TV) regularization term on the predicted mean image across all subjects. It denoises the images from all subjects and at the same time returns the coefficient maps estimation. We propose an algorithm to solve this optimization problem, which is efficient when combined with recent advances in graph fused lasso solvers. The statistical consistency of the estimator is shown via an oracle inequality.   Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing methods with separate denoising and regression steps. Especially, SIR shows an evident advantage in recovering signals in small regions. We apply SIR on Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative data and produce interpretable brain maps of the PET image to patient-level features include age, gender, genotype and disease groups.|['Ying Liu', 'Bowei Yan']|['stat.ME', 'stat.AP']

However, developing response-adaptive trial designs that offer patient benefit while ensuring the resulting trial avoids bias and provides a statistically rigorous comparison of the different treatments included is highly challenging. In this paper, the theory of Multi-Armed Bandit Problems is used to define a family of near optimal adaptive designs in the context of a clinical trial with a normally distributed endpoint with known variance. Through simulation studies based on an ongoing trial as a motivation we report the operating characteristics (type I error, power, bias) and patient benefit of these approaches and compare them to traditional and existing alternative designs. These results are then compared to those recently published in the context of Bernoulli endpoints. Many limitations and advantages are similar in both cases but there are also important differences, specially with respect to type I error control. This paper proposes a simulation-based testing procedure to correct for the observed type I error inflation that bandit-based and adaptive rules can induce. Results presented extend recent work by considering a normally distributed endpoint, a very common case in clinical practice yet mostly ignored in the response-adaptive theoretical literature, and illustrate the potential advantages of using these methods in a rare disease context. We also recommend a suitable modified implementation of the bandit-based adaptive designs for the case of common diseases.|['Adam Smith', 'Sofia S. Villar']|['stat.AP']

Previous studies evaluating the impact of these programs are either limited by the number of health outcomes or of medical conditions considered. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of a pay-for-performance program on the basis of five health outcomes and across a wide range of medical conditions. The context of the study is the Lombardy region in Italy, where a rewarding program was introduced in 2012. The policy evaluation is based on a difference-in-differences approach. The model includes multiple dependent outcomes, that allow quantifying the joint effect of the program, and random effects, that account for the heterogeneity of the data at the ward and hospital level. Our results show that the policy had a positive effect on the hospitals' performance in terms of those outcomes that can be more influenced by a managerial activity, namely the number of readmissions, transfers and returns to the surgery room. No significant changes which can be related to the pay-for-performance introduction are observed for the number of voluntary discharges and for mortality. Finally, our study shows evidence that the medical wards have reacted more strongly to the pay-for-performance program than the surgical ones, whereas only limited evidence is found in support of a different policy reaction across different types of hospital ownership.|['Alina Peluso', 'Paolo Berta', 'Veronica Vinciotti']|['stat.AP']

It can be used in situ to provide data inexpensively and rapidly compared to the standard laboratory measurements. Because most spectral data bases contain air-dried samples scanned in the laboratory, field spectra acquired in situ are either absent or rare in calibration data sets. However, when models are calibrated on air-dried spectra, prediction using field spectra are often inaccurate. We propose a framework to calibrate partial least squares models when field spectra are rare using synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE). We calibrated a model to predict soil organic carbon content using air-dried spectra spiked with synthetic field spectra.

One purported advantage of replacing or augmenting human judgment with computer models in high stakes settings-- such as sentencing, hiring, policing, college admissions, and parole decisions-- is the perceived ""neutrality"" of computers. It is argued that because computer models do not hold personal prejudice, the predictions they produce will be equally free from prejudice. There is growing recognition that employing algorithms does not remove the potential for bias, and can even amplify it if the training data were generated by a process that is itself biased. In this paper, we provide a probabilistic notion of algorithmic bias. We propose a method to eliminate bias from predictive models by removing all information regarding protected variables from the data to which the models will ultimately be trained. Unlike previous work in this area, our framework is general enough to accommodate data on any measurement scale. Motivated by models currently in use in the criminal justice system that inform decisions on pre-trial release and parole, we apply our proposed method to a dataset on the criminal histories of individuals at the time of sentencing to produce ""race-neutral"" predictions of re-arrest. In the process, we demonstrate that a common approach to creating ""race-neutral"" models-- omitting race as a covariate-- still results in racially disparate predictions. We then demonstrate that the application of our proposed method to these data removes racial disparities from predictions with minimal impact on predictive accuracy."|['James E.

There is considerable interest in using RAR designs in drug development for rare diseases, where traditional designs are not feasible or ethically objectionable. In this paper we discuss and address a major criticism of RAR: the undesirable type I error inflation due to unknown time trends in the trial. Time trends can appear because of changes in the characteristics of recruited patients - so-called ""patient drift"". Patient drift is a realistic concern for clinical trials in rare diseases because these typically recruit patients over a very long period of time. We compute by simulations how large the type I error inflation is as a function of the time trend magnitude in order to determine in which contexts a potentially costly correction is actually necessary. We then assess the ability of different correction methods to preserve type I error in this context and their performance in terms of other operating characteristics, including patient benefit and power. We make recommendations of which correction methods are most suitable in the rare disease context for several RAR rules, differentiating between the two-armed and the multi-armed case. We further propose a RAR design for multi-armed clinical trials, which is computationally cheap and robust to several time trends considered."|['Sofia S.

In this study we examine the impact of internal climate variability on seasonal wind power density fluctuations using 30 simulations from the Large Ensemble Project (LENS) developed at the National Center for Atmospheric Research. Furthermore, a spatio-temporal model for daily wind speed is proposed with neighbor-based cross-temporal dependence, and a multivariate skew-t distribution to capture the spatial patterns of higher order moments.

As discussed in the meta-analysis by Jaeger et al., 2017, faster reading times are observed at the verb are in the agreement-attraction sentence above compared to the equally ungrammatical sentence ""The key to the cabinet are on the table"". One explanation for this facilitation effect is the feature percolation account: the plural feature on cabinets percolates up to the head noun key, leading to the illusion. An alternative account is in terms of cue-based retrieval (Lewis & Vasishth, 2005), which assumes that the non-subject noun cabinets is misretrieved due to a partial feature-match when a dependency completion process at the auxiliary initiates a memory access for a subject with plural marking. We present evidence for yet another explanation for the observed facilitation. Because the second sentence has two nouns with identical number, it is possible that these are, in some proportion of trials, more difficult to keep distinct, leading to slower reading times at the verb in the first sentence above; this is the feature overwriting account of Nairne, 1990. We show that the feature overwriting proposal can be implemented as a finite mixture process. We reanalysed ten published data-sets, fitting hierarchical Bayesian mixture models to these data assuming a two-mixture distribution. We show that in nine out of the ten studies, a mixture distribution corresponding to feature overwriting furnishes a superior fit over both the feature percolation and the cue-based retrieval accounts."|['Shravan Vasishth', 'Lena A.

These networks are extracted from observed fMRI using data-driven analytic methods such as independent component analysis (ICA). A notable limitation of these FC methods is that they do not provide any information on the underlying structural connectivity (SC), which is believed to serve as the basis for interregional interactions in brain activity. We propose a new statistical measure of the strength of SC (sSC) underlying FC networks obtained from data-driven methods. The sSC measure is developed using information from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data, and can be applied to compare the strength of SC across different FC networks. Furthermore, we propose a reliability index for data-driven FC networks to measure the reproducibility of the networks through re-sampling the observed data. To perform statistical inference such as hypothesis testing on the sSC, we develop a formal variance estimator of sSC based a spatial semivariogram model with a novel distance metric. We demonstrate the performance of the sSC measure and its estimation and inference methods with simulation studies. For real data analysis, we apply our methods to a multimodal imaging study with resting-state fMRI and DTI data from 20 healthy controls and 20 subjects with major depressive disorder. Results show that well-known resting state networks all demonstrate higher SC within the network as compared to the average structural connections across the brain. We also found that sSC is positively associated with the reliability index, indicating that the FC networks that have stronger underlying SC are more reproducible across samples.|['Phebe Brenne Kemmer', 'F.

The projection coefficients can be treated as features of the graphs. We also propose a random graph model which generalizes classical random graph model and can be used to model multiple graphs. We show through theory and numerical experiments that under the model, the joint embedding method produces estimates of parameters with small errors. Via simulation experiments, we demonstrate that the joint embedding method produces features which lead to state of the art performance in classifying graphs.

Interactions between circulating respiratory viruses (f.e., influenza) and cardiac conditions have been suggested as a cause of winter-dominant mortality patterns. We propose and implement a way to estimate an upper bound on mortality attributable to winter-dominant viruses like influenza. We calculate 'pseudo-seasonal' life expectancy, dividing the year into two six-month spans, one encompassing winter the other summer. During the summer when the circulation of respiratory viruses is drastically reduced, life expectancy is about one year longer. We also quantify the seasonal mortality difference in terms of seasonal ""equivalent ages"" (defined herein) and proportional hazards.

To provide a fair assessment of each transplant center, an effect that represents the center-specific care quality, along with patient level risk factors, is often included in the risk adjustment model. In the past, the center effects have been modeled as either fixed effects or Gaussian random effects, with various pros and cons. Our numerical analyses reveal that the distributional assumptions do impact the prediction of center effects especially when the effect is extreme. To bridge the gap between these two approaches, we propose to model the transplant center effect as a latent random variable with a finite Gaussian mixture distribution. Such latent Gaussian mixture models provide a convenient framework to study the heterogeneity among the transplant centers. To overcome the weak identifiability issues, we propose to estimate the latent Gaussian mixture model using a penalized likelihood approach, and develop sequential locally restricted likelihood ratio tests to determine the number of components in the Gaussian mixture distribution. The fitted mixture model provides a convenient means of controlling the false discovery rate when screening for underperforming or outperforming transplant centers.

Super Learner (SL) is a generic ensemble learning algorithm that uses cross-validation to select among a ""library"" of candidate prediction models. The SL is not restricted to a single prediction model, but uses the strengths of a variety of learning algorithms to adapt to different databases. While the SL has been shown to perform well in a number of settings, it has not been thoroughly evaluated in large electronic healthcare databases that are common in pharmacoepidemiology and comparative effectiveness research. In this study, we applied and evaluated the performance of the SL in its ability to predict treatment assignment using three electronic healthcare databases. We considered a library of algorithms that consisted of both nonparametric and parametric models. We also considered a novel strategy for prediction modeling that combines the SL with the high-dimensional propensity score (hdPS) variable selection algorithm. Predictive performance was assessed using three metrics: the negative log-likelihood, area under the curve (AUC), and time complexity.

In the spatio-temporal setting, several families of covariance functions exist to accommodate a wide variety of dependence structures arising in different applications. These parametric families can be restrictive and are insufficient in some situations. In contrast, process convolutions represent a flexible, interpretable approach to defining the covariance of a Gaussian process and have modest requirements to ensure validity. We introduce a generalization of the process convolution approach that employs multiple convolutions sequentially to form a ""process convolution chain."" In our proposed multi-stage framework, complex dependencies that arise from a combination of different interacting mechanisms are decomposed into a series of interpretable kernel smoothers. We demonstrate an application of process convolution chains to model killer whale movement, in which the paths taken by multiple individuals are not independent, but reflect dynamic social interactions within the population. Our proposed model for dependent movement provides inference for the latent dynamic social structure in the study population. Additionally, by leveraging the positive dependence among individual paths, we achieve a reduction in uncertainty for the estimated locations of the whales, compared to a model that treats paths as independent."|['Henry R.

To be credible an observational study that tests many causal hypotheses must demonstrate that its conclusions are neither artifacts of multiple testing nor of small biases from nonrandom treatment assignment. In a sense that needs to be defined carefully, hidden within a sensitivity analysis for nonrandom assignment is an enormous correction for multiple testing: in the absence of bias, it is extremely improbable that multiple testing alone would create an association insensitive to moderate biases. We propose a new strategy called ""cross-screening"", different from but motivated by recent work of Bogomolov and Heller on replicability. Cross-screening splits the data in half at random, uses the first half to plan a study carried out on the second half, then uses the second half to plan a study carried out on the first half, and reports the more favorable conclusions of the two studies correcting using the Bonferroni inequality for having done two studies. If the two studies happen to concur, then they achieve Bogomolov-Heller replicability; however, importantly, replicability is not required for strong control of the family-wise error rate, and either study alone suffices for firm conclusions. In randomized studies with a few hypotheses, cross-split screening is not an attractive method when compared with conventional methods of multiplicity control, but it can become attractive when hundreds or thousands of hypotheses are subjected to sensitivity analyses in an observational study. We illustrate the technique by comparing 46 biomarkers in individuals who consume large quantities of fish versus little or no fish."|['Qingyuan Zhao', 'Dylan S. Small', 'Paul R.

The market is a black market, and so contracts cannot be enforced. We study the role that reputation plays in alleviating adverse selection in this market. We document the following stylized facts: (i) There is a positive relationship between the price and the rating of a seller. This effect is increasing in the number of reviews left for a seller. A mature highly-rated seller charges a 20% higher price than a mature low-rated seller. (ii) Sellers with more reviews charge higher prices regardless of rating. (iii) Low-rated sellers are more likely to exit the market and make fewer sales. We show that these stylized facts are explained by a dynamic model of adverse selection, ratings, and exit, in which buyers form rational inferences about the quality of a seller jointly from his rating and number of sales. Sellers who receive low ratings initially charge the same price as highly-rated sellers since early reviews are less informative about quality. Bad sellers exit rather than face lower prices in the future. We provide conditions under which our model admits a unique equilibrium. We estimate the model, and use the result to compute the returns to reputation in the market. We find that the market would have collapsed due to adverse selection in the absence of a rating system.|['Nick Janetos', 'Jan Tilly']|['stat.AP']

This online smoother cannot be used directly in the case of partially observed stochastic differential equations since the transition density of the latent data is usually unknown.

In this study, we use Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) images from healthy normal, early PD and SWEDD subjects, as obtained from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) database, and process them to compute shape- and surface fitting-based features for the three groups. We use these features to develop and compare various classification models that can discriminate between scans showing dopaminergic deficit, as in PD, from scans without the deficit, as in healthy normal or SWEDD. Along with it, we also compare these features with Striatal Binding Ratio (SBR)-based features, which are well-established and clinically used, by computing a feature importance score using Random forests technique. We observe that the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier gave the best performance with an accuracy of 97.29%. These features also showed higher importance than the SBR-based features. We infer from the study that shape analysis and surface fitting are useful and promising methods for extracting discriminatory features that can be used to develop diagnostic models that might have the potential to help clinicians in the diagnostic process.|['R.

In neuroimaging, however, the computational burden of running such algorithm can be significant. We find that by viewing the permutation testing procedure as the construction of a very large permutation testing matrix $T$, one can exploit structural properties derived from the data and the test statistics to reduce the runtime under certain conditions. In particular, we see that $T$ has a low-rank plus a low-variance residual. This makes $T$ a good candidate for low-rank matrix completion methods, where only a very small number of entries of $T$ ($~0.35\%$ of all entries in our experiments) have to be computed to obtain good estimate of it. Based on this observation, we developed an algorithm, RapidPT, that is able to efficiently recover the max null distribution commonly obtained through regular permutation testing in neuroimage analysis. We present an extensive experimental validation on four varying sized datasets against two baselines: Statistical NonParametric Mapping (SnPM13) and a standard permutation testing implementation (referred to as NaivePT). We find that RapidPT achieves its best runtime performance on medium sized datasets ($50 \leq n \leq 200$), with speedup gains of 1.5x - 38x (vs. SnPM13) and 20x-1000x (vs. NaivePT). For larger datasets ($n \geq 200$) RapidPT outperforms NaivePT (6x - 200x), and provides substantial speedups over SnPM13 when performing more than 10000 permutations (2x - 15x). The Matlab implementation is available as a standalone toolbox called RapidPT. Our code is also integrated within SnPM13, and is able to leverage multi-core architectures when available.|['Felipe Gutierrez-Barragan', 'Vamsi K.

One major drawback of this censoring scheme is that very few observations (even no observation at all) may be observed at the end of the experiment. To overcome this problem, Cho, Sun and Lee (\textit{Statistical Methodology}, 23, 18-34, 2015) recently introduced generalized progressive censoring which ensures to get a pre specified number of failures. In this paper we analyze generalized progressive censored data in presence of competing risks. For brevity we have considered only two competing causes of failures, and it is assumed that the lifetime of the competing causes follow one parameter exponential distributions with different scale parameters. We obtain the maximum likelihood estimators of the unknown parameters and also provide their exact distributions. Based on the exact distributions of the maximum likelihood estimators exact confidence intervals can be obtained. Asymptotic and bootstrap confidence intervals are also provided for comparison purposes. We further consider the Bayesian analysis of the unknown parameters under a very flexible Beta-Gamma prior. We provide the Bayes estimates and the associated credible intervals of the unknown parameters based on the above priors.

We developed a mathematical model for the 2015 Zika virus outbreak dynamics in Colombia, El Salvador, and Suriname. We fit the model to publicly available data provided by the Pan American Health Organization, using Approximate Bayesian Computation to estimate parameter distributions and provide uncertainty quantification. An important model input is the at-risk susceptible population, which can vary with a number of factors including climate, elevation, population density, and socio-economic status. We informed this initial condition using the highest historically reported dengue incidence modified by the probable dengue reporting rates in the chosen countries. The model indicated that a country-level analysis was not appropriate for Colombia. We then estimated the basic reproduction number, or the expected number of new human infections arising from a single infected human, to range between 4 and 6 for El Salvador and Suriname with a median of 4.3 and 5.3, respectively.

The standard method to assess the water quality of a catchment, or a group of catchments, usually involves collecting point measurements of water quality and other additional information such as the date and time of measurements, rainfall amounts, the land-use and soil-type of the catchment and the elevation. Some of this auxiliary information will be point data, measured at the exact location, whereas other such as land-use will be areal data often in a compositional format. Two problems arise if analysts try to incorporate this information into a statistical model in order to predict (for example) the influence of land-use on water quality. First is the spatial change of support problem that arises when using areal data to predict outcomes at point locations. Secondly, the physical process driving water quality is not compositional, rather it is the observation process that provides compositional data. In this paper we present an approach that accounts for these two issues by using a latent variable to identify the land-use that most likely influences water quality. This latent variable is used in a spatial mixture model to help estimate the influence of land-use on water quality. We demonstrate the potential of this approach with data from a water quality research study in the Mount Lofty range, in South Australia.|['Adrien Ickowicz', 'Jessica H. Ford', 'Keith R.

Understanding tumor heterogeneity is therefore critical to precise cancer prognosis and treatment. In this paper, we introduce BayCount, a Bayesian decomposition method to infer tumor heterogeneity with highly over-dispersed RNA sequencing count data. Using negative binomial factor analysis, BayCount takes into account both the between-sample and gene-specific random effects on raw counts of sequencing reads mapped to each gene. For posterior inference, we develop an efficient compound Poisson based blocked Gibbs sampler. Through extensive simulation studies and analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas lung cancer and kidney cancer RNA sequencing count data, we show that BayCount is able to accurately estimate the number of subclones, the proportions of these subclones in each tumor sample, and the gene expression profiles in each subclone. Our method represents the first effort in characterizing tumor heterogeneity using RNA sequencing count data that simultaneously removes the need of normalizing the counts, achieves statistical robustness, and obtains biologically and clinically meaningful insights.|['Fangzheng Xie', 'Mingyuan Zhou', 'Yanxun Xu']|['stat.AP']

These technologies allow us to create metrics to empirically investigate urban design principles of the past half-century. Philadelphia is an interesting case study for this work, with its rapid urban development and population increase in the last decade. We focus on features of what urban planners call ""vibrancy"": measures of positive, healthy activity or energy in an area. Historically, vibrancy has been very challenging to measure empirically. We explore the association between safety (violent and non-violent crime) and features of local neighborhood vibrancy such as population, economic measures and land use zoning. Despite rhetoric about the negative effects of population density in the 1960s and 70s, we find very little association between crime and population density. Measures based on land use zoning are not an adequate description of local vibrancy and so we construct a database and set of measures of business activity in each neighborhood. We employ several matching analyses within census block groups to explore the relationship between neighborhood vibrancy and safety at a higher resolution. We find that neighborhoods with more vacancy have higher crime but within neighborhoods, crimes tend not to be located near vacant properties. We also find that more crimes occur near business locations but businesses that are active (open) for longer periods are associated with fewer crimes."|['Colman Humphrey', 'Shane T.

However, the MPE, similar to the mean-squared error (MSE), depends on the ground-truth parameter, and has to be estimated from the noisy observations. We consider linear shrinkage-based denoising functions, wherein the optimum shrinkage parameter is obtained by minimizing an estimate of the MPE. When the probability of error is integrated over $\epsilon$, it leads to the expected $\ell_1$ distortion. The proposed MPE and $\ell_1$ distortion formulations are applicable to various noise distributions by invoking a Gaussian mixture model approximation. Within the realm of MPE, we also develop an extension of the transform-domain shrinkage by grouping transform coefficients, resulting in $\textit{subband shrinkage}$. The denoising performance obtained within the proposed framework is shown to be better than that obtained using the minimum MSE-based approaches formulated within $\textbf{$\textit {Stein's unbiased risk estimation}$}$ (SURE) framework, especially in the low measurement signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. Performance comparison with three state-of-the-art denoising algorithms, carried out on electrocardiogram signals and two test signals taken from the $\textit{Wavelab}$ toolbox, exhibits that the MPE framework results in consistent SNR gains for input SNRs below $5$ dB.|['Jishnu Sadasivan', 'Subhadip Mukherjee', 'Chandra Sekhar Seelamantula']|['stat.AP']

Such subpopulations are known as subclones and are an important target for precision medicine. Reconstructing such subclones from next-generation sequencing (NGS) data is one of the major challenges in precision medicine. We present PairClone as a new tool to implement this reconstruction. The main idea of PairClone is to model short reads mapped to pairs of proximal SNVs. In contrast, most existing methods use only marginal reads for unpaired SNVs. Using Bayesian nonparametric models, we estimate posterior probabilities of the number, genotypes and population frequencies of subclones in one or more tumor sample. We use the categorical Indian buffet process (cIBP) as a prior probability model for subclones that are represented as vectors of categorical matrices that record the corresponding sets of mutation pairs.

Identifying the source of food-borne zoonoses (e.g. an animal reservoir or food product) is crucial for the identification and prioritisation of food safety interventions. For many zoonotic diseases it is difficult to attribute human cases to sources of infection because there is little epidemiological information on the cases. However, microbial strain typing allows zoonotic pathogens to be categorised, and the relative frequencies of the strain types among the sources and in human cases allows inference on the likely source of each infection. We introduce sourceR, an R package for quantitative source attribution, aimed at food-borne diseases. It implements a fully joint Bayesian model using strain-typed surveillance data from both human cases and source samples, capable of identifying important sources of infection. The model measures the force of infection from each source, allowing for varying survivability, pathogenicity and virulence of pathogen strains, and varying abilities of the sources to act as vehicles of infection. A Bayesian non-parametric (Dirichlet process) approach is used to cluster pathogen strain types by epidemiological behaviour, avoiding model overfitting and allowing detection of strain types associated with potentially high 'virulence'.   sourceR is demonstrated using Campylobacter jejuni isolate data collected in New Zealand between 2005 and 2008. It enables straightforward attribution of cases of zoonotic infection to putative sources of infection by epidemiologists and public health decision makers. As sourceR develops, we intend it to become an important and flexible resource for food-borne disease attribution studies.|['Poppy Miller', 'Jonathan Marshall', 'Nigel French', 'Chris Jewell']|['stat.AP']

We present the first ever method to remove this assumption from vaccination uptake estimation: our method dynamically adapts to temporal fluctuations in time series web data used to estimate vaccination uptake. We show our method to outperform the state of the art compared to competitive baselines that use not only web data but also curated clinical data. This performance improvement is more pronounced for vaccines whose uptake has been irregular due to negative media attention (HPV-1 and HPV-2), problems in vaccine supply (DiTeKiPol), and targeted at children of 12 years old (whose vaccination is more irregular compared to younger children).|['Niels Dalum Hansen', 'Kåre Mølbak', 'Ingemar J.

Outcomes such as birth defects are rare events in the general population, which often translate to very small numbers of events in the unexposed group. As drug safety studies in pregnancy are typically observational in nature, we control for confounding in this rare events setting using propensity scores (PS). Using our empirical data, we noticed that the estimated odds ratio for birth defects due to exposure varied drastically depending on the specific approach used. The commonly used approaches with PS are matching, stratification, inverse probability weighting (IPW) and regression adjustment. The extremely rare events setting renders the matching or stratification infeasible. In addition, the PS itself may be formed via different approaches to select confounders from a relatively long list of potential confounders. We carried out simulation experiments to compare different combinations of approaches: IPW or regression adjustment, with 1) including all potential confounders without selection, 2) selection based on univariate association between the candidate variable and the outcome, 3) selection based on change in effects (CIE). The simulation showed that IPW without selection leads to extremely large variances in the estimated odds ratio, which help to explain the empirical data analysis results that we had observed. The simulation also showed that IPW with selection based on univariate association with the outcome is preferred over IPW with CIE. Regression adjustment has small variances of the estimated odds ratio regardless of the selection methods used.|['Ronghui Xu', 'Jue Hou', 'Christina D. Chambers']|['stat.AP']

A common misconception is that the dependence revealed by these measures must be specific to the spectral range of the filtered input signals. Implicitly or explicitly, obtaining analytic phase involves normalizing the signal by its own envelope, which is a nonlinear operation that introduces broad spectral leakage. We review how this generates bias and complicates the interpretation of commonly used measures of phase locking. A specific example of this effect may create spurious phase locking as a consequence of nonzero circular mean in the phase of input signals, which can be viewed as spectral leakage to 0 Hz. Corrections for this problem which recenter or uniformize the distribution of phase may fail when the amplitudes of the compared signals are correlated. To address the more general problem of spectral bias, a novel measure of phase locking is proposed, the amplitude-weighted phase locking value (awPLV). This measure is closely related to coherence, but it removes ambiguities of interpretation that detract from the latter.|['Christopher K. Kovach']|['q-bio.NC', 'stat.AP', '94A12']

They emphasize the sparsity of the coding coefficients but without considering the local structure of the input data. To overcome the shortcoming, aiming at the difficult problem of plant leaf recognition on the large-scale database, a two-stage local similarity based classification learning method is proposed by combining local mean-based classification method and local WSRC. In the first stage, LMC is applied to coarsely classifying the test sample. nearest neighbors of the test sample, as a neighbor subset, is selected from each training class, then the local geometric center of each class is calculated. S candidate neighbor subsets of the test sample are determined with the first smallest distances between the test sample and each local geometric center. In the second stage, LWSRC is proposed to approximately represent the test sample through a linear weighted sum of all samples of the candidate neighbor subsets. The rationale of the proposed method is as follows: the first stage aims to eliminate the training samples that are far from the test sample and assume that these samples have no effects on the ultimate classification decision, then select the candidate neighbor subsets of the test sample. Thus the classification problem becomes simple with fewer subsets; the second stage pays more attention to those training samples of the candidate neighbor subsets in weighted representing the test sample. This is helpful to accurately represent the test sample. Experimental results on the leaf image database demonstrate that the proposed method not only has a high accuracy and low time cost, but also can be clearly interpreted.|['Shanwen Zhang', 'Harry Wang', 'Wenzhun Huang']|['stat.AP']

Permutation tests are a nonparametric alternative that require minimal assumptions which are often guaranteed by the randomization that was conducted. We compare analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), a special case of linear regression that incorporates stratification, to several permutation tests based on linear models that control for pretreatment covariates. In simulations using a variety of data-generating processes, some of which violate the parametric assumptions, the permutation tests maintain power comparable to ANCOVA. We illustrate the use of these permutation tests alongside ANCOVA with data from a clinical trial comparing the effectiveness of two treatments for gastroesophageal reflux disease.

They claimed: 1) false positive rates (FPRs) in traditional approaches are greatly inflated, questioning the validity of ""countless published fMRI studies""; 2) nonparametric methods produce valid, but slightly conservative, FPRs; 3) a common flawed assumption is that the spatial autocorrelation function (ACF) of FMRI noise is Gaussian-shaped; and 4) a 15-year-old bug in AFNI's 3dClustSim significantly contributed to producing ""particularly high"" FPRs compared to other software. We repeated simulations from [1] (Beijing-Zang data [2], see [3]), and comment on each point briefly."|['Robert W. Cox', 'Gang Chen', 'Daniel R. Glen', 'Richard C. Reynolds', 'Paul A.

(2016) have become a large topic within (and outside) neuroimaging. They concluded that: existing parametric methods for determining statistically significant clusters had greatly inflated FPRs (""up to 70%,"" mainly due to the faulty assumption that the noise spatial autocorrelation function is Gaussian- shaped and stationary), calling into question potentially ""countless"" previous results; in contrast, nonparametric methods, such as their approach, accurately reflected nominal 5% FPRs. They also stated that AFNI showed ""particularly high"" FPRs compared to other software, largely due to a bug in 3dClustSim. We comment on these points using their own results and figures and by repeating some of their simulations. Briefly, while parametric methods show some FPR inflation in those tests (and assumptions of Gaussian-shaped spatial smoothness also appear to be generally incorrect), their emphasis on reporting the single worst result from thousands of simulation cases greatly exaggerated the scale of the problem. Importantly, FPR statistics depend on ""task"" paradigm and voxelwise p-value threshold; as such, we show how results of their study provide useful suggestions for FMRI study design and analysis, rather than simply a catastrophic downgrading of the field's earlier results. Regarding AFNI (which we maintain), 3dClustSim's bug-effect was greatly overstated - their own results show that AFNI results were not ""particularly"" worse than others. We describe further updates in AFNI for characterizing spatial smoothness more appropriately (greatly reducing FPRs, though some remain >5%); additionally, we outline two newly implemented permutation/randomization-based approaches producing FPRs clustered much more tightly about 5% for voxelwise p<=0.01."|['Robert W.

This paper considers the problem of analyzing two repeated measurements of microbiome data from the same subjects. Such data are often collected to assess the change of microbial composition after certain treatment, or the difference in microbial compositions across body sites. Existing models for such count data are limited in modeling the covariance structure of the counts and in handling paired multinomial count data. A new probability distribution is proposed for paired-multinomial count data, which allows flexible covariance structure and can be used to model repeatedly measured multivariate count data. Based on this distribution, a test statistic is developed for testing the difference in compositions based on paired multinomial count data. The proposed test can be applied to the count data observed on a taxonomic tree in order to test difference in microbiome compositions and to identify the subtrees with different subcompositions. Simulation results indicate that proposed test has correct type 1 errors and increased power compared to some commonly used methods. An analysis of an upper respiratory tract microbiome data set is used to illustrate the proposed methods.|['Pixu Shi', 'Hongzhe Li']|['stat.AP']

While understandable, relying on intuition over models has often been found to result in inferior outcomes. Here we present a new method, select-regress-and-round, for constructing simple rules that perform well for complex decisions. These rules take the form of a weighted checklist, can be applied mentally, and nonetheless rival the performance of modern machine learning algorithms. Our method for creating these rules is itself simple, and can be carried out by practitioners with basic statistics knowledge. We demonstrate this technique with a detailed case study of judicial decisions to release or detain defendants while they await trial. In this application, as in many policy settings, the effects of proposed decision rules cannot be directly observed from historical data: if a rule recommends releasing a defendant that the judge in reality detained, we do not observe what would have happened under the proposed action. We address this key counterfactual estimation problem by drawing on tools from causal inference. We find that simple rules significantly outperform judges and are on par with decisions derived from random forests trained on all available features. Generalizing to 22 varied decision-making domains, we find this basic result replicates. We conclude with an analytical framework that helps explain why these simple decision rules perform as well as they do.|['Jongbin Jung', 'Connor Concannon', 'Ravi Shroff', 'Sharad Goel', 'Daniel G.

These estimates will depend largely on the number of wells and their location. The drilling costs are so high that they do not allow new wells to be placed for uncertainty assessment. Besides that difficulty, usual geostatistical models do not account for the uncertainty of conceptual models, which should be considered.   Spatial bootstrap is applied to assess the estimate reliability when resampling from original field is not an option. Considering different realities (conceptual models) and different scenarios (estimates), spatial bootstrapping applied with Bayesian update allows uncertainty assessment of the initial estimate and of the conceptual model.

The objective of these inspections is to minimise the risk of contraband entering the country. As an example, for regulatory authorities in charge of biosecurity material, consignments of goods are classified before arrival according to their economic tariff number (Department of Immigration and Border Protection, 2016). This classification, perhaps along with other information, is used as a screening step to determine whether further biosecurity intervention, such as inspection, is necessary. Other information associated with consignments includes details such as the country of origin, supplier, and importer, for example.   The choice of which consignments to inspect has typically been informed by historical records of intercepted material. Fortunately for regulators, interception is a rare event, however this sparsity undermines the utility of historical records for deciding which containers to inspect.   In this paper we report on an analysis that uses more detailed information to inform inspection. Using quarantine biosecurity as a case study, we create statistical profiles using generalised linear mixed models and compare different model specifications with historical information alone, demonstrating the utility of a statistical modelling approach. We also demonstrate some graphical model summaries that provide managers with insight into pathway governance.|['Stephen E Lane', 'Tony Arthur', 'Christina Aston', 'Sam Zhao', 'Andrew P Robinson']|['stat.AP']

Intercepting BRM carried by non-compliant international passengers is a key priority of border biosecurity services. Global travel rates are constantly increasing, which complicates this important responsibility, and necessitates judicious intervention. Selection of passengers for intervention is generally performed manually, and the quality of the selection depends on the experience and judgement of the officer making the selection. In this article we report on a case study to assess the predictive ability of statistical profiling methods that predict non-compliance with biosecurity regulations using data obtained from regulatory documents as inputs. We then evaluate the performance arising from using risk predictions to select higher risk passengers for screening. We find that both prediction performance and screening higher risk passengers from regulatory documents are superior to manual and random screening, and recommend that authorities further investigate statistical profiling for efficient intervention of biosecurity risk material on incoming passengers.|['Stephen E Lane', 'Richard Gao', 'Matthew Chisholm', 'Andrew P Robinson']|['stat.AP']

Thus, a methodology to evaluate stationarity of the interspike intervals (ISIs) is presented and applied to various IF models.

However, to date the existence of these species of black holes remains ambiguous and their formation process is therefore unknown. It has been long suspected that black holes with masses $10^{2}-10^{4}M_{\odot}$ should form and reside in dense stellar systems. Therefore, dedicated observational campaigns have targeted globular cluster for many decades searching for signatures of these elusive objects. All candidates found in these targeted searches appear radio dim and do not have the X-ray to radio flux ratio predicted by the fundamental plane for accreting black holes. Based on the lack of an electromagnetic counterpart upper limits of $2060 M_{\odot}$ and $470 M_{\odot}$ have been placed on the mass of a putative black hole in 47 Tucanae (NGC 104) from radio and X-ray observations respectively. Here we show there is evidence for a central black hole in 47 Tuc with a mass of M$_{\bullet}\sim2200 M_{\odot}$$_{-800}^{+1500}$ when the dynamical state of the globular cluster is probed with pulsars. The existence of an intermediate mass black hole in the centre of one of the densest clusters with no detectable electromagnetic counterpart suggests that the black hole is not accreting at a sufficient rate and therefore contrary to expectations is gas starved. This intermediate mass black hole might be a member of electromagnetically invisible population of black holes that are the elusive seeds leading to the formation of supermassive black holes in galaxies.|['Bülent Kızıltan', 'Holger Baumgardt', 'Abraham Loeb']|['astro-ph.GA', 'astro-ph.IM', 'astro-ph.SR', 'stat.AP']

Various data compression techniques can be used to mitigate this problem, but traditional algorithms deliver relatively small compression rates by focusing on individual simulations. We propose a statistical model that aims at reproducing the data-generating mechanism of an ensemble of runs by providing a stochastic approximation of global annual wind data and compressing all the scientific information in the estimated statistical parameters. We introduce an evolutionary spectrum approach with spatially varying parameters based on large-scale geographical descriptors such as altitude to better account for different regimes across the Earth's orography. We consider a multi-step conditional likelihood approach to estimate the parameters that explicitly accounts for nonstationary features while also balancing memory storage and distributed computation, and we apply the proposed model to more than 18 million points on yearly global wind speed. The proposed model achieves compression rates that are orders of magnitude higher than those achieved by traditional algorithms on yearly-averaged variables, and once the statistical model is fitted, decompressed runs can be almost instantaneously generated to better assess wind speed uncertainty due to internal variability.|['Jaehong Jeong', 'Stefano Castruccio', 'Paola Crippa', 'Marc G.

Although sinusoidal parameter estimation has been extensively studied, our model differs from those examined in the available literature by the inclusion of an offset term. We derive both the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) solution and the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) on the variance of the model's estimators.|['A. Pasha Hosseinbor', 'Renat Zhdanov']|['stat.AP']

We identified two potential sources of human induced biases that can lead to disparate conclusions. We illustrate through a complex phenotype that robust results can still be drawn after accounting for such biases.   Often predictive models build based in high dimensional data suffers from the drawback of lack of interpretability. To achieve interpretability in the form of description of the organism level phenomena in term of molecular or cellular level activities, functional and pathway information is often augmented. Functional information can greatly facilitate the interpretation of the results of the predictive model.   However an important aspect of (vertical) data augmentation is routinely ignored, that is there could be several stages of analysis where such information could be meaningfully integrated. There is no know criteria to enable us to assess the effect of such augmentation. A novel aspect of the proposed work is in exploring possibilities of stages of analysis where functional information may be incorporated and in assessing the extent to which the ultimate conclusions would differ depending on level of amalgamation.   To boost our confidence on the key findings a first level of meta-analysis is done by exploring different levels of data augmentation. This is followed by comparison of predictive models across different definitions of the same phenotype developed by different groups, which is also an extended form of meta-analysis.   We have used real life data on a complex phenotype to illustrate the above. The data pertains to Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) and another novel aspect of the current work is in modeling the underlying continuous symptom measurements for CFS, which is the first for this disease to our knowledge.|['Madhuchhanda Bhattacharjee']|['stat.AP']

In experiments with multiple indirect dimensions, new undersampling approaches were recently proposed: random phase detection (RPD) \cite{Maciejewski11} and its generalization, partial component sampling (PCS) \cite{Schuyler13}. The new approaches are fully aware of the fact that high-dimensional experiments generate hypercomplex-valued free induction decays; they randomly acquire only certain low-dimensional components of each high-dimensional hypercomplex entry. We provide a classification of various hypercomplex-aware undersampling schemes, and define a hypercomplex-aware coherence appropriate for such undersampling schemes; we then use it to quantify undersampling artifacts of RPD and various PCS schemes.|['Hatef Monajemi', 'David L.

This is especially of paramount significance in the large-scale grids due to their geographical expansions and the large volume of data generated. This paper proposes a stochastic graphical framework, by leveraging which it aims to localize the anomalies with the minimum amount of data. This framework capitalizes on the strong correlation structures observed among the measurements collected from different buses. The proposed approach, at its core, collects the measurements sequentially and progressively updates its decision about the location of the anomaly. The process resumes until the location of the anomaly can be identified with desired reliability. We provide a general theory for the quickest anomaly localization and also investigate its application for quickest line outage localization. Simulations in the IEEE 118-bus model are provided to establish the gains of the proposed approach.|['Javad Heydari', 'Ali Tajer']|['stat.AP', 'cs.IT', 'math.IT']

We present simulation results to assess the performance of the method.

Here I give the statistical details underlying the default, weakly informative priors used in all models when the user does not specify the priors. Our approach is to first deduce what the variances of the slopes would be if we were instead to have defined the priors on the partial correlation scale, and then to set independent Normal priors on the slopes with variances equal to these implied variances. Our approach is similar in spirit to that of Zellner's g-prior (Zellner 1986), in that it involves a multivariate normal prior on the regression slopes, with a tuning parameter to control the width or informativeness of the priors irrespective of the scales of the data and predictors. The primary differences are that here the tuning parameter is directly interpretable as the standard deviation of the distribution of plausible partial correlations, and that this tuning parameter can have different values for different coefficients. The default priors for the intercepts and random effects are ultimately based on the prior slope variances.|['Jacob Westfall']|['stat.AP']
