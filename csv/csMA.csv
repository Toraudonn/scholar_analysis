  Spaces","Many societal decision problems lie in high-dimensional continuous spaces not
amenable to the voting techniques common for their discrete or
single-dimensional counterparts. These problems are typically discretized
before running an election or decided upon through negotiation by
representatives. We propose a meta-algorithm called \emph{Iterative Local
Voting} for collective decision-making in this setting in which voters are
sequentially sampled and asked to modify a candidate solution within some local
neighborhood of its current value as defined by a ball in some chosen norm. In
general such schemes do not converge or when they do the resulting solution
does not have a natural description.
  We first prove the convergence of this algorithm under appropriate choices of
neighborhoods to plausible solutions in certain natural settings: when the
voters' utilities can be expressed in terms of some form of distance from their
ideal solution and when these utilities are additively decomposable across
dimensions. In many of these cases we obtain convergence to the societal
welfare maximizing solution.
  We then describe an experiment in which we test our algorithm for the
decision of the U.S. Federal Budget on Mechanical Turk with over 4000 workers
employing neighborhoods defined by $\mathcal{L}^1 \mathcal{L}^2$ and
$\mathcal{L}^\infty$ balls. We make several observations that inform future

  Planning","We propose distributed online open loop planning (DOOLP) a general framework
for online multiagent coordination and decision making under uncertainty. DOOLP
is based on online heuristic search in the space defined by a generative model
of the domain dynamics which is exploited by agents to simulate and evaluate
the consequences of their potential choices.
  We also propose distributed online Thompson sampling (DOTS) as an effective
instantiation of the DOOLP framework. DOTS models sequences of agent choices by
concatenating a number of multiarmed bandits for each agent and uses Thompson
sampling for dealing with action value uncertainty. The Bayesian approach
underlying Thompson sampling allows to effectively model and estimate
uncertainty about (a) own action values and (b) other agents' behavior. This
approach yields a principled and statistically sound solution to the
exploration-exploitation dilemma when exploring large search spaces with
limited resources.

The target follows a linear dynamics corrupted by an adversarial noise i.e.

loss is a sum of local losses each of which is associated to one agent. Agents
noisy observations could be nonlinear. We formulate this problem as a
distributed online optimization where agents communicate with each other to
track the minimizer of the global loss. We then propose a decentralized version
of the Mirror Descent algorithm and provide the non-asymptotic analysis of the
problem. Using the notion of dynamic regret we measure the performance of our
algorithm versus its offline counterpart in the centralized setting. We prove
that the bound on dynamic regret scales inversely in the network spectral gap

attacker where controller's goal is to maneuver the plant (a simple model of
flocking dynamics) into a V-formation and the goal of the attacker is to
prevent the controller from doing so. Controllers in V-formation games utilize
a new formulation of model-predictive control we call Adaptive-Horizon MPC
(AMPC) giving them extraordinary power: we prove that under certain
controllability assumptions an AMPC controller is able to attain V-formation
with probability 1.
  We define several classes of attackers including those that in one move can
remove R birds from the flock or introduce random displacement into flock
dynamics. We consider both naive attackers whose strategies are purely
probabilistic and AMPC-enabled attackers putting them on par strategically
with the controllers. While an AMPC-enabled controller is expected to win every
game with probability 1 in practice it is resource-constrained: its maximum
prediction horizon and the maximum number of game execution steps are fixed.
Under these conditions an attacker has a much better chance of winning a
V-formation game.
  Our extensive performance evaluation of V-formation games uses statistical
model checking to estimate the probability an attacker can thwart the
controller. Our results show that for the bird-removal game with R = 1 the
controller almost always wins (restores the flock to a V-formation). For R = 2
the game outcome critically depends on which two birds are removed. For the
displacement game our results again demonstrate that an intelligent attacker

the captured sensors but still cannot simply ignore them due to the multiple

this work can be summarized as the introduction of two novel algorithms; one
for symmetric graphs and one for graphs that are possibly asymmetric. Under

such as power systems the Internet of Things or intelligent transportation
systems is that traditional distributed optimal control methods do not scale
gracefully neither in controller synthesis nor in controller implementation
to systems composed of millions billions or even trillions of interacting
subsystems. This paper shows that this challenge can now be addressed by
leveraging the recently introduced System Level Approach (SLA) to controller
synthesis. In particular in the context of the SLA we define suitable notions
of separability for control objective functions and system constraints such
that the global optimization problem (or iterate update problems of a
distributed optimization algorithm) can be decomposed into parallel
subproblems. We then further show that if additional locality (i.e. sparsity)
constraints are imposed then these subproblems can be solved using local
models and local decision variables. The SLA is essential to maintaining the
convexity of the aforementioned problems under locality constraints. As a
consequence the resulting synthesis methods have $O(1)$ complexity relative to
the size of the global system. We further show that many optimal control
problems of interest such as (localized) LQR and LQG $\mathcal{H}_2$ optimal
control with joint actuator and sensor regularization and (localized) mixed
$\mathcal{H}_2/\mathcal{L}_1$ optimal control problems satisfy these notions
of separability and use these problems to explore tradeoffs in performance

  Control in Elections","Voter control problems model situations in which an external agent tries
toaffect the result of an election by adding or deleting the fewest number of
voters. The goal of the agent is to make a specific candidate either win
(\emph{constructive} control) or lose (\emph{destructive} control) the
election. We study the constructive and destructive voter control problems
whenadding and deleting voters have a \emph{combinatorial flavor}: If we add
(resp.\ delete) a voter~$v$ we also add (resp.\ delete) a bundle~$\kappa(v) $
of voters that are associated with~$v$. While the bundle~$\kappa(v)$ may have
more than one voter a voter may also be associated with more than one voter.
We analyze the computational complexity of the four voter control problems for
the Plurality rule. We obtain that in general making a candidate lose is
computationally easier than making her win. In particular if the bundling
relation is symmetric (i.e.\ $\forall w\colon w \in \kappa(v) \Leftrightarrow v
\in \kappa(w) $) and if each voter has at most two voters associated with him
then destructive control is polynomial-time solvable while the constructive
variant remains $\NP$-hard. Even if the bundles are disjoint (i.e.\ $\forall
w\colon w \in \kappa(v) \Leftrightarrow \kappa(v) = \kappa(w) $) the
constructive problem variants remain intractable. Finally the minimization
variant of constructive control by adding voters does not admit an efficient

only able to communicate with each other intermittently through a cloud server.
To reduce the amount of required communication we develop a self-triggered
algorithm that allows agents to communicate with the cloud only when necessary
rather than at some fixed period. Unlike the vast majority of similar works
that propose distributed event- and/or self-triggered control laws this work
doesn't assume agents can be ""listening"" continuously. In other words when an
event is triggered by one agent neighboring agents will not be aware of this
until the next time they establish communication with the cloud themselves.
Using a notion of ""promises"" about future control inputs agents are able to
keep track of higher quality estimates about their neighbors allowing them to
stay disconnected from the cloud for longer periods of time while still
guaranteeing a positive contribution to the global task. We show that our

agent and the interaction between agents. Thus it motivates us to leverage the
distributed constraint optimization problem (DCOP) a framework of modeling
MAS to solve the user association problem in heterogeneous networks (HetNets).
Two issues we have to consider when we take DCOP into the application of HetNet
including: (i) How to set up an effective model by DCOP taking account of the
negtive impact of the increment of users on the modeling process (ii) Which
kind of algorithms is more suitable to balance the time consumption and the
quality of soltuion. Aiming to overcome these issues we firstly come up with
an ECAV-$\eta$ (Each Connection As Variable) model in which a parameter $\eta$
with an adequate assignment ($\eta=3$ in this paper) is able to control the
scale of the model. After that a Markov chain (MC) based algorithm is proposed
on the basis of log-sum-exp function. Experimental results show that the
solution obtained by DCOP framework is better than the one obtained by the
Max-SINR algorithm. Comparing with the Lagrange dual decomposition based method
(LDD) the solution performance has been improved since there is no need to
transform original problem into a satisfied one. In addition it is also
apparent that the DCOP based method has better robustness than LDD when the

to use Tullock contests as an alternative tool to design incentive mechanisms
for crowdsourcing. We are inspired by the conduciveness of Tullock contests to
attracting user entry (yet not necessarily a higher revenue) in other domains.
In this paper we explore a new dimension in optimal Tullock contest design by
superseding the contest prize---which is fixed in conventional Tullock
contests---with a prize function that is dependent on the (unknown) winner's
contribution in order to maximize the crowdsourcer's utility. We show that
this approach leads to attractive practical advantages: (a) it is well-suited
for rapid prototyping in fully distributed web agents and smartphone apps; (b)
it overcomes the disincentive to participate caused by players' antagonism to
an increasing number of rivals. Furthermore we optimize conventional
fixed-prize Tullock contests to construct the most superior benchmark to
compare against our mechanism. Through extensive evaluations we show that our
mechanism significantly outperforms the optimal benchmark by over three folds
on the crowdsourcer's utility cum profit and up to nine folds on the players'

former. This embedding also sheds light on the relation between delegation
cycles in liquid democracy and the probability of collective abstentions as

These processes---called Boolean DeGroot processes---are a special case of the

identify the target. Thus the agents develop their own language interactively

optimal plans (action sequences) that take an initial state of a Markov
Decision Process (MDP) to a state whose cost is below a specified (convergence)
threshold. ARES uses Particle Swarm Optimization with adaptive sizing for both
the receding horizon and the particle swarm. Inspired by Importance Splitting
the length of the horizon and the number of particles are chosen such that at
least one particle reaches a next-level state that is a state where the cost
decreases by a required delta from the previous-level state. The level relation
on states and the plans constructed by ARES implicitly define a Lyapunov
function and an optimal policy respectively both of which could be explicitly
generated by applying ARES to all states of the MDP up to some topological
equivalence relation. We also assess the effectiveness of ARES by statistically
evaluating its rate of success in generating optimal plans. The ARES algorithm
resulted from our desire to clarify if flying in V-formation is a flocking
policy that optimizes energy conservation clear view and velocity alignment.
That is we were interested to see if one could find optimal plans that bring a
flock from an arbitrary initial state to a state exhibiting a single connected
V-formation. For flocks with 7 birds ARES is able to generate a plan that
leads to a V-formation in 95% of the 8000 random initial configurations within
63 seconds on average. ARES can also be easily customized into a

heterogeneous agents to achieve both their individual and collective goals. In
this paper we focus on a special case of coalition formation known as
Graph-Constrained Coalition Formation (GCCF) whereby a network connecting the
agents constrains the formation of coalitions. We focus on this type of problem
given that in many real-world applications agents may be connected by a
communication network or only trust certain peers in their social network. We
propose a novel representation of this problem based on the concept of edge
contraction which allows us to model the search space induced by the GCCF
problem as a rooted tree. Then we propose an anytime solution algorithm
(CFSS) which is particularly efficient when applied to a general class of
characteristic functions called $m+a$ functions. Moreover we show how CFSS can
be efficiently parallelised to solve GCCF using a non-redundant partition of
the search space. We benchmark CFSS on both synthetic and realistic scenarios
using a real-world dataset consisting of the energy consumption of a large
number of households in the UK. Our results show that in the best case the
serial version of CFSS is 4 orders of magnitude faster than the state of the
art while the parallel version is 9.44 times faster than the serial version on
a 12-core machine. Moreover CFSS is the first approach to provide anytime
approximate solutions with quality guarantees for very large systems of agents

beliefs are both vague and uncertain. Vagueness is represented by a third truth
state meaning \emph{borderline}. This is combined with a probabilistic model of
uncertainty. A belief combination operator is then proposed which exploits
borderline truth values to enable agents with conflicting beliefs to reach a
compromise. A number of simulation experiments are carried out in which agents
apply this operator in pairwise interactions under the bounded confidence
restriction that the two agents' beliefs must be sufficiently consistent with
each other before agreement can be reached. As well as studying the consensus
operator in isolation we also investigate scenarios in which agents are
influenced either directly or indirectly by the state of the world. For the
former we conduct simulations which combine consensus formation with belief
updating based on evidence. For the latter we investigate the effect of
assuming that the closer an agent's beliefs are to the truth the more visible
they are in the consensus building process. In all cases applying the consensus
operators results in the population converging to a single shared belief which
is both crisp and certain. Furthermore simulations which combine consensus
formation with evidential updating converge faster to a shared opinion which is
closer to the actual state of the world than those in which beliefs are only
changed as a result of directly receiving new evidence. Finally if agent
interactions are guided by belief quality measured as similarity to the true
state of the world then applying the consensus operator alone results in the
population converging to a high quality shared belief.",Michael Crosscombe|Jonathan Lawry,cs.MA|cs.AI

  Ant-Inspired Robot Swarms","Individual robots are not effective at exploring large unmapped areas. An
alternate approach is to use a swarm of simple robots that work together
rather than a single highly capable robot. The central-place foraging algorithm
(CPFA) is effective for coordinating robot swarm search and collection tasks.
Robots start at a centrally placed location (nest) explore potential targets
in the area without global localization or central control and return the
targets to the nest. The scalability of the CPFA is limited because large
numbers of robots produce more inter-robot collisions and large search areas
result in substantial travel costs. We address these problems with the
multiple-place foraging algorithm (MPFA) which uses multiple nests distributed
throughout the search area. Robots start from a randomly assigned home nest but
return to the closest nest with found targets. We simulate the foraging
behavior of robot swarms in the robot simulator ARGoS and employ a genetic
algorithm to discover different optimized foraging strategies as swarm sizes
and the number of targets are scaled up. In our experiments the MPFA always
produces higher foraging rates fewer collisions and lower travel and search
time compared to the CPFA for the partially clustered targets distribution. The
main contribution of this paper is that we systematically quantify the
advantages of the MPFA (reduced travel time and collisions) the potential

each agent can compute and communicate independently at different times for
different durations with the information it has even if the latest information
from its neighbors is not yet available. Such an asynchronous algorithm reduces
the time that agents would otherwise waste idle because of communication delays
or because their neighbors are slower. It also eliminates the need for a global
clock for synchronization. Mathematically the algorithm involves both primal
and dual variables uses fixed step-size parameters and provably converges to
the exact solution under a bounded delay assumption and a random agent
assumption. When running synchronously the algorithm performs just as well as

The problem of preservation of structural controllability under simultaneous

corresponding results are exploited to introduce some useful indices and
importance measures that help characterize and quantify the role of individual
links and agents in the controllability of the overall network. Existing
results are then extended by considering the effects of losses in both links
and agents at the same time. To this end the concepts of joint

quantitative measures of reliability for a multi-agent system and their
important properties are investigated. Lastly the class of jointly critical
digraphs is introduced and it is stated that if a digraph is jointly critical

(HJ) reachability is the ideal tool for guaranteeing goal satisfaction and

cases becomes intractable when there are more than two vehicles due to the
exponentially scaling computational complexity with respect to system

provides and eliminate the computation burden by assigning a strict priority
ordering to the vehicles under consideration. Under this sequential path
planning (SPP) scheme vehicles reserve ""space-time"" portions in the airspace
and the space-time portions guarantee dynamic feasibility collision avoidance

complexity that scales quadratically when accounting for both disturbances and

consisting of all preference profiles which can be extended to single crossing
preference profiles with respect to some tree by adding more preferences to it.
We call this domain the weakly single crossing domain on trees. We present a
polynomial time algorithm for recognizing weakly single crossing profiles on
trees. We then move on to develop a polynomial time algorithm with low query
complexity for eliciting weakly single crossing profiles on trees even when we
do not know any tree with respect to which the closure of the input profile is
single crossing and the preferences can be queried only sequentially; moreover
the sequential order is also unknown. We complement the performance of our
preference elicitation algorithm by proving that our algorithm makes an optimal
number of queries up to constant factors when the number of preferences is
large compared to the number of candidates even if the input profile is known
to be single crossing with respect to some given tree and the preferences can
be accessed randomly.",Palash Dey,cs.MA|cs.AI|cs.DS

  constraints","The problem of the distributed recovery of jointly sparse signals has
attracted much attention recently. Let us assume that the nodes of a network
observe different sparse signals with common support; starting from linear
compressed measurements and exploiting network communication each node aims
at reconstructing the support and the non-zero values of its observed signal.
In the literature distributed greedy algorithms have been proposed to tackle
this problem among which the most reliable ones require a large amount of
transmitted data which barely adapts to realistic network communication
constraints. In this work we address the problem through a reweighted $\ell_1$
soft thresholding technique in which the threshold is iteratively tuned based
on the current estimate of the support. The proposed method adapts to
constrained networks as it requires only local communication among neighbors
and the transmitted messages are indices from a finite set. We analytically
prove the convergence of the proposed algorithm and we show that it outperforms
the state-of-the-art greedy methods in terms of balance between recovery
accuracy and communication load.",Sophie M. Fosson|Javier Matamoros|Carles Anton-Haro|Enrico Magli,math.OC|cs.MA

framework that allows simulating large-scale IoT environments while keeping
high levels of detail when it is needed. We consider a use case based on the
deployment of smart services in decentralized territories. A two level
simulator is employed which is based on a coarse agent-based adaptive
parallel and distributed simulation approach to model the general life of
simulated entities. However when needed a finer grained simulator (based on
OMNeT++) is triggered on a restricted portion of the simulated area which
allows considering all issues concerned with wireless communications. Based on

is rooted in the Bayes rule but avoids the complexities of rational inference
in partially observed environments with incomplete information which are
characteristic of group interactions. Our model is also consistent with a
dual-process psychological theory of thinking: the group members behave
rationally at the initiation of their interactions with each other (the slow
and deliberative mode); however in the ensuing decision epochs they rely on a
heuristic that replicates their experiences from the first stage (the fast
automatic mode). We specialize this model to a group decision scenario where
private observations are received at the beginning and agents aim to take the
best action given the aggregate observations of all group members. We study the
implications of the information structure together with the properties of the
probability distributions which determine the structure of the so-called
""Bayesian heuristics"" that the agents follow in our model. We also analyze the
group decision outcomes in two classes of linear action updates and log-linear
belief updates and show that many inefficiencies arise in group decisions as a
result of repeated interactions between individuals leading to overconfident
beliefs as well as choice-shifts toward extremes. Nevertheless balanced
regular structures demonstrate a measure of efficiency in terms of aggregating
the initial information of individuals. These results not only verify some

arises often in practice. There are several models of incomplete information

well-studied model of incompleteness the votes are given by partial orders
over the candidates. In this context we can frame the problem of finding a
possible winner which involves determining whether a given candidate wins in
at least one completion of a given set of partial votes for a specific voting
rule.
  The possible winner problem is well-known to be NP-complete in general and
it is in fact known to be NP-complete for several voting rules where the number
of undetermined pairs in every vote is bounded only by some constant. In this
paper we address the question of determining precisely the smallest number of
undetermined pairs for which the possible winner problem remains NP-complete.
In particular we find the exact values of $t$ for which the possible winner
problem transitions to being NP-complete from being in P where $t$ is the
maximum number of undetermined pairs in every vote. We demonstrate tight
results for a broad subclass of scoring rules which includes all the commonly
used scoring rules (such as plurality veto Borda $k$-approval and so on)

benefit all users simultaneously. Fairness is crucial in participatory decision
making since generating equitable outcomes is an important goal of these
processes. We argue that the classic game theoretic notion of core captures
fairness in the setting. To compute the core we first develop a novel
characterization of a public goods market equilibrium called the Lindahl
equilibrium which is always a core solution. We then provide the first (to our
knowledge) polynomial time algorithm for computing such an equilibrium for a
broad set of utility functions; our algorithm also generalizes (in a
non-trivial way) the well-known concept of proportional fairness. We use our
theoretical insights to perform experiments on real participatory budgeting
voting data. We empirically show that the core can be efficiently computed for
utility functions that naturally model our practical setting and examine the

attention from the research community; the simplest and most thoroughly studied
of them are consensus protocols in the form of differential or difference
equations over general time-varying weighted graphs. These graphs are usually
characterized algebraically by their associated Laplacian matrices. Network
algorithms with similar algebraic graph theoretic structures called being of
Laplacian-type in this paper also arise in other related multi-agent control
problems such as aggregation and containment control target surrounding
distributed optimization and modeling of opinion evolution in social groups. In
spite of their similarities each of such algorithms has often been studied
using separate mathematical techniques. In this paper a novel approach is
offered allowing a unified and elegant way to examine many Laplacian-type
algorithms for multi-agent coordination. This approach is based on the analysis
of some differential or difference inequalities that have to be satisfied by
the some ""outputs"" of the agents (e.g. the distances to the desired set in
aggregation problems). Although such inequalities may have many unbounded
solutions under natural graphic connectivity conditions all their bounded
solutions converge (and even reach consensus) entailing the convergence of the
corresponding distributed algorithms. In the theory of differential equations
the absence of bounded non-convergent solutions is referred to as the
equation's dichotomy. In this paper we establish the dichotomy criteria of

  Games","In this paper we propose a class of propagation models for multiple competing
products over a social network. We consider two propagation mechanisms: social
conversion and self conversion corresponding respectively to endogenous and
exogenous factors. A novel concept the product-conversion graph is proposed
to characterize the interplay among competing products. According to the
chronological order of social and self conversions we develop two Markov-chain
models and based on the independence approximation we approximate them with
two respective difference equations systems.
  Theoretical analysis on these two approximation models reveals the dependency
of the systems' asymptotic behavior on the structures of both the
product-conversion graph and the social network as well as the initial
condition. In addition to the theoretical work accuracy of the independence
approximation and the asymptotic behavior of the Markov-chain model are
investigated via numerical analysis for the case where social conversion
occurs before self conversion.
  Finally we propose a class of multi-player and multi-stage competitive
propagation games and discuss the seeding-quality trade-off as well as the
allocation of seeding resources among the individuals. We investigate the
unique Nash equilibrium at each stage and analyze the system's behavior when
every player is adopting the policy at the Nash equilibrium.",Wenjun Mei|Francesco Bullo,cs.SI|cs.MA|math.DS

collectively execute a sequence of tasks and whose actions are determined by
individual skill levels and networks of interpersonal appraisals and influence.
The closely-related proposed models have increasing complexity starting with a
centralized manager-based assignment and learning model and finishing with a
social model of interpersonal appraisal assignments learning and influences.
We show how rational optimal behavior arises along the task sequence for each
model and discuss conditions of suboptimality. Our models are grounded in

  model","Axelrod's model with $F=2$ cultural features where each feature can assume
$k$ states drawn from a Poisson distribution of parameter $q$ exhibits a
continuous nonequilibrium phase transition in the square lattice. Here we use
extensive Monte Carlo simulations and finite size scaling to study the critical
behavior of the order parameter $\rho$ which is the fraction of sites that
belong to the largest domain of an absorbing configuration averaged over many
runs. We find that it vanishes as $\rho \sim \left (q_c^0 - q \right)^\beta$
with $\beta \approx 0.25$ at the critical point $q_c^0 \approx 3.10$ and that
the exponent that measures the width of the critical region is $\nu^0 \approx
2.1$. In addition we find that introduction of long-range links by rewiring
the nearest-neighbors links of the square lattice with probability $p$ turns
the transition discontinuous with the critical point $q_c^p$ increasing from
$3.1$ to $27.17$ approximately as $p$ increases from $0$ to $1$. The
sharpness of the threshold as measured by the exponent $\nu^p \approx 1$ for
$p>0$ increases with the square root of the number of nodes of the resulting
small-world network.",Sandro M. Reia|José F. Fontanari,cond-mat.stat-mech|cs.MA|physics.soc-ph

heterogeneous agents each with strongly convex cost function depending on the
average population state and all sharing a convex constraint towards a
competitive aggregative equilibrium. We assume an information structure through
which a central controller has access to the average population state and can
broadcast control signals for steering the decentralized optimal responses of
the agents. We propose a dynamic control law that based on monotone operator
theory arguments ensures global convergence to an equilibrium independently on
the problem data that are the cost functions and the constraints local and
global of the agents. We illustrate the proposed method in two application
domains: demand side management and network congestion control.",Sergio Grammatico,math.OC|cs.GT|cs.MA|cs.SY

  coarse-grained information to compete for limited resources","The recent trend for acquiring big data assumes that possessing
quantitatively more and qualitatively finer data necessarily provides an
advantage that may be critical in competitive situations. Using a model complex
adaptive system where agents compete for a limited resource using information
coarse-grained to different levels we show that agents having access to more
and better data can perform worse than others in certain situations. The
relation between information asymmetry and individual payoffs is seen to be
complex depending on the composition of the population of competing agents.",V. Sasidevan|Appilineni Kushal|Sitabhra Sinha,physics.soc-ph|cs.MA|q-fin.TR

  Mobility On Demand Systems","Autonomous Mobility On Demand (MOD) systems can utilize fleet management
strategies to properly position vehicles and allocate customers in order to
maintain a high customer quality of service (QoS). Previous works on autonomous
MOD systems have developed methods for rebalancing single capacity vehicles
where QoS is maintained through large fleet sizing. This work focuses on MOD
systems utilizing a small number of vehicles such as those found on a campus
where additional vehicles cannot be introduced as demand for rides increases. A
predictive positioning method is presented for improving customer QoS in
small-fleet MOD systems by identifying key locations which minimize expected
customer wait time. Ridesharing is introduced as a means for improving customer
QoS as arrival rates increase. However with ridesharing perceived QoS is
dependent on an often unknown customer preference. To address this challenge a
customer ratings model which learns customer preference from a 5-star rating
is developed and incorporated directly into a ridesharing algorithm. The
predictive positioning and ridesharing methods are applied to simulation of a
real-world campus MOD system. A combined predictive positioning and ridesharing
approach is shown to reduce customer service times by up to 29%. and the
customer ratings model is shown to provide the best overall MOD fleet
management performance over a range of customer preferences.",Justin Miller|Jonathan P. How,cs.MA
