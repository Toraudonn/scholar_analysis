  Multilevel Data Sets","We propose a copula based method to handle missing values in multivariate
data of mixed types in multilevel data sets. Building upon the extended rank
likelihood of \cite{hoff2007extending} and the multinomial probit model our
model is a latent variable model which is able to capture the relationship
among variables of different types as well as accounting for the clustering
structure. We fit the model by approximating the posterior distribution of the
parameters and the missing values through a Gibbs sampling scheme. We use the
multiple imputation procedure to incorporate the uncertainty due to missing
values in the analysis of the data. Our proposed method is evaluated through
simulations to compare it with several conventional methods of handling missing
data. We also apply our method to a data set from a cluster randomized
controlled trial of a multidisciplinary intervention in acute stroke units. We
conclude that our proposed copula based imputation model for mixed type
variables achieves reasonably good imputation accuracy and recovery of
parameters in some models of interest and that adding random effects enhances
performance when the clustering effect is strong.",Jiali Wang|Bronwyn Loong|Anton H. Westveld|Alan H. Welsh,stat.ME

together we should in fact use the grand mean to estimate the mean of the
population with the larger sample mean. If they are separated by more than a
certain threshold we should shrink the observed means towards each other. As
intuition suggests it is only if the observed means are far apart that we
should conclude that the magnitude of separation and consequent ranking are not
due to chance. Unlike other methods our approach does not need to pre-specify

similarly to an interval-censored Cox proportional hazards model fit when the

  Hyperspectral Unmixing Method Dealing with Intra-class Variability","Blind source separation is a common processing tool to analyse the
constitution of pixels of hyperspectral images. Such methods usually suppose
that pure pixel spectra (endmembers) are the same in all the image for each
class of materials. In the framework of remote sensing such an assumption is
no more valid in the presence of intra-class variabilities due to illumination
conditions weathering slight variations of the pure materials etc... In this
paper we first describe the results of investigations highlighting intra-class
variability measured in real images. Considering these results a new
formulation of the linear mixing model is presented leading to two new methods.
Unconstrained Pixel-by-pixel NMF (UP-NMF) is a new blind source separation
method based on the assumption of a linear mixing model which can deal with
intra-class variability. To overcome UP-NMF limitations an extended method is
proposed named Inertia-constrained Pixel-by-pixel NMF (IP-NMF). For each
sensed spectrum these extended versions of NMF extract a corresponding set of
source spectra. A constraint is set to limit the spreading of each source's
estimates in IP-NMF. The methods are tested on a semi-synthetic data set built
with spectra extracted from a real hyperspectral image and then numerically
mixed. We thus demonstrate the interest of our methods for realistic source
variabilities. Finally IP-NMF is tested on a real data set and it is shown to

Most existing methods for analyzing these data consider spatial and temporal
profiles separately with the implicit assumption that different brain regions
develop in similar trajectories and that the spatial patterns of gene
expression remain similar at different time points. Al- though these analyses
may help delineate gene regulation either spatially or temporally they are not
able to characterize heterogeneity in temporal dynamics across different brain
regions or the evolution of spatial patterns of gene regulation over time. In
this article we develop a statistical method based on low rank tensor
decomposition to more effectively analyze spatiotemporal gene expression data.
We generalize the clas- sical principal component analysis (PCA) which is
applicable only to data matrices to tensor PCA that can simultaneously capture
spatial and temporal effects. We also propose an efficient algorithm that
combines tensor unfolding and power iteration to estimate the tensor principal
components and provide guarantees on their statistical performances. Numerical

the prior distribution) is a crucial component of the model criticism process.
However a systematic assessment of conflict in evidence syntheses suffers from
the multiple testing problem through testing for conflict at multiple
locations in a model. We demonstrate how conflict diagnostics can be employed
throughout a graphical model while accounting for the multiple hypothesis tests

rely on the magnitude of coefficient estimates to decide which variables to
include in the final model. However coefficient estimates are unreliable when
the design matrix is collinear. To overcome this challenge an entirely new

inference framework. This new procedure is able to effectively account for
linear dependencies among subsets of covariates in a high-dimensional setting
where $p$ can grow almost exponentially in $n$ as well as in the classical
setting where $p \le n$.
  It is shown that the procedure very naturally assigns small probabilities to
subsets of covariates which include redundancies by way of explicit $L_{0}$
minimization. Furthermore with a typical sparsity assumption it is shown that
the proposed method is consistent in the sense that the probability of the true
sparse subset of covariates converges in probability to 1 as $n \to \infty$ or
as $n \to \infty$ and $p \to \infty$. Very reasonable conditions are needed
and little restriction is placed on the class of $2^{p}$ possible subsets of

inappropriate for high dimensional applications. When a large number of
parameters are estimated marginal confidence intervals associated with the
most significant estimates have very low coverage rates: They are too small and
centered at biased estimates. The problem of forming confidence intervals in
high dimensional settings has previously been studied through the lens of
selection adjustment. In this framework the goal is to control the proportion
of non-covering intervals formed for selected parameters.
  In this paper we approach the problem by considering the relationship between
rank and coverage probability. Marginal confidence intervals have very low
coverage rates for significant parameters and high rates for parameters with
more boring estimates. Many selection adjusted intervals display the same
pattern. This connection motivates us to propose a new coverage criterion for
confidence intervals in multiple testing/covering problems --- the rank
conditional coverage (RCC). This is the expected coverage rate of an interval
given the significance ranking for the associated estimator. We propose
interval construction via bootstrapping which produces small intervals and have
a rank conditional coverage close to the nominal level. These methods are

  phylogenetics","In phylogenetics alignments of molecular sequence data for a collection of
species are used to learn about their phylogeny - an evolutionary tree which
places these species as leaves and ancestors as internal nodes. Sequence
evolution on each branch of the tree is generally modelled using a continuous
time Markov process characterised by an instantaneous rate matrix. Early
models assumed the same rate matrix governed substitutions at all sites of the
alignment ignoring the variation in evolutionary constraints. Substantial
improvements in phylogenetic inference and model fit were achieved by
augmenting these models with a set of multiplicative random effects that
allowed different sites to evolve at different rates which scaled the baseline
rate matrix. Motivated by this pioneering work we consider an extension which
allows quadratic rather than linear site-specific transformations of the
baseline rate matrix.
  We derive properties of the resulting process and show that when combined
with a particular class of non-stationary models we obtain one that allows
sequence composition to vary across both sites of the alignment and taxa.
Formulating the model in a Bayesian framework a Markov chain Monte Carlo
algorithm for posterior inference is described. We consider two applications to
alignments concerning the tree of life fitting stationary and non-stationary
models. In each case we compare inferences obtained under our site-specific
quadratic transformation with those under linear and site-homogeneous models.",Sarah E. Heaps|Tom M. W. Nye|Richard J. Boys|Tom A. Williams|Svetlana Cherlin|T. Martin Embley,stat.ME

from a statistical learning view. Originally motivated by pursuing a
theoretical understanding of the maximum correntropy criterion based regression
(MCCR) our study reveals that MCCR with a tending-to-zero scale parameter is
essentially modal regression. We show that nonparametric modal regression
problem can be approached via the classical empirical risk minimization. Some
efforts are then made to develop a framework for analyzing and implementing
modal regression. For instance the modal regression function is described the
modal regression risk is defined explicitly and its \textit{Bayes} rule is
characterized; for the sake of computational tractability the surrogate modal
regression risk which is termed as the generalization risk in our study is
introduced. On the theoretical side the excess modal regression risk the
excess generalization risk the function estimation error and the relations
among the above three quantities are studied rigorously. It turns out that
under mild conditions function estimation consistency and convergence may be
pursued in modal regression as in vanilla regression protocols such as mean
regression median regression and quantile regression. However it outperforms
these regression models in terms of robustness as shown in our study from a
re-descending M-estimation view. This coincides with and in return explains the
merits of MCCR on robustness. On the practical side the implementation issues
of modal regression including the computational algorithm and the tuning
parameters selection are discussed. Numerical assessments on modal regression
are also conducted to verify our findings empirically.",Yunlong Feng|Jun Fan|Johan A. K. Suykens,stat.ML|math.ST|stat.ME|stat.TH

density of one dimensional dataset constructing an authentic possibly-gapped
histogram becomes rather complex. The candidate ensemble is described via a
two-layer Ising model and its size is shown to grow exponentially. This
exponential complexity makes any exhaustive search in-feasible and all boundary
parameters local. For data compression via Uniformity the decoding error
criterion is nearly independent of sample size. These characteristics nullify
statistical model selection techniques such as Minimum Description Length

computable. A data-driven algorithm is devised to construct such histograms
along the branching hierarchy of a Hierarchical Clustering tree. Such resultant
histograms naturally manifest data's physical information contents:
deterministic structures of bin-boundaries coupled with stochastic structures
of Uniformity within each bin. Without enforcing unrealistic Normality and
constant variance assumptions an application of possibly-gapped histogram is
devised called analysis of Histogram (ANOHT) to replace Analysis of Variance

extensively used to generate reliable statistics by ""borrowing strength"" from
other areas and related variables through suitable models. Outliers adversely
influence standard model-based small area estimates. To deal with outliers
Sinha and Rao (2009) proposed a robust frequentist approach. In this article
we present a robust Bayesian alternative to the nested error regression model
for unit-level data to mitigate outliers. We consider a two-component scale
mixture of normal distributions for the unit-level error to model outliers and
present a computational approach to produce Bayesian predictors of small area
means under a noninformative prior for model parameters. A real example and
extensive simulations convincingly show robustness of our Bayesian predictors
to outliers. Simulations comparison of these two procedures with Bayesian
predictors by Datta and Ghosh (1991) and M-quantile estimators by Chambers et
al. (2014) shows that our proposed procedure is better than the others in terms
of bias variability and coverage probability of prediction intervals when

performance of this interval depends greatly on the data-based model weights on
which it is based. A computationally convenient formula for the coverage
probability of this interval is provided by Kabaila Welsh and Abeysekera

consider the more complicated scenario that there are many (32768 in the

specified set of components of the regression parameter vector we either set
the component to zero or let it vary freely. We provide an easily-computed

in Friedman and Popescu (2008) where rules from decision trees and linear terms
are used in a L1-regularized regression. We modify RuleFit by replacing the
L1-regularization by a horseshoe prior which is well known to give aggressive
shrinkage of noise predictor while leaving the important signal essentially
untouched. This is especially important when a large number of rules are used
as predictors as many of them only contribute noise. Our horseshoe prior has an
additional hierarchical layer that applies more shrinkage a priori to rules
with a large number of splits and to rules that are only satisfied by a few
observations. The aggressive noise shrinkage of our prior also makes it
possible to complement the rules from boosting in Friedman and Popescu (2008)
with an additional set of trees from random forest which brings a desirable
diversity to the ensemble. We sample from the posterior distribution using a
very efficient and easily implemented Gibbs sampler. The new model is shown to
outperform state-of-the-art methods like RuleFit BART and random forest on 16

decisions on treatment selection according to each patient's specific
characteristics. Recently outcome weighted learning (OWL) has been proposed to
estimate such an optimal ITR in a binary treatment setting by maximizing the
expected clinical outcome. However for ordinal treatment settings such as
individualized dose finding it is unclear how to use OWL. In this paper we

variable is available. Our optimality criterion is with respect to delaying
time to occurrence of an event of interest (e.g. death or relapse of cancer).
We leverage semiparametric efficiency theory to construct estimators with
desirable properties such as double robustness. We propose two estimators of
the optimal ITR which arise from considering two loss functions aimed at (i)
directly estimating the conditional treatment effect (also know as the blip
function) and (ii) recasting the problem as a weighted classification problem
that uses the 0-1 loss function. Our estimators are \textit{super learning}
ensembles that minimize the cross-validated risk of a linear combination of
estimators in a user-supplied library of candidate estimators. We prove oracle
inequalities bounding the finite sample excess risk of the estimator. The
bounds depend on the excess risk of the oracle selector and the bias in
estimation of the nuisance parameters. These oracle inequalities imply
asymptotic optimality of the estimated optimal ITR in the sense that one of the
two following claims holds: the estimated optimal ITR is consistent or it is
equivalent with the oracle selector. In a randomized trial with uninformative
censoring we show that the value of the super learner based on (ii) achieves
rate at least as fast as $\log n/n$whereas the value of the super learner

distinguish between the two groups by such analysis. Activity time series also
exhibited a multifractal pattern. A paired analysis of the spectra indices for

  emulation approach for models with high-dimensional output","In order to understand underlying processes governing environmental and
physical processes and predict future outcomes a complex computer model is
frequently required to simulate these dynamics. However there is inevitably
uncertainty related to the exact parametric form or the values of such
parameters to be used when developing these simulators with \emph{ranges} of
plausible values prevalent in the literature. Systematic errors introduced by
failing to account for these uncertainties have the potential to have a large
effect on resulting estimates in unknown quantities of interest. Due to the
complexity of these types of models it is often unfeasible to run large
numbers of training runs that are usually required for full statistical
emulators of the environmental processes. We therefore present a method for
accounting for uncertainties in complex environmental simulators without the
need for very large numbers of training runs and illustrate the method through
an application to the Met Office's atmospheric transport model NAME. We
conclude that there are two principle parameters that are linked with
variability in NAME outputs namely the free tropospheric turbulence parameter
and particle release height. Our results suggest the former should be
significantly larger than is currently implemented as a default in NAME whilst
changes in the latter most likely stem from inconsistencies between the model
specified ground height at the observation locations and the true height at
this location. Estimated discrepancies from independent data are consistent

a time series of observations stems from one of $N$ possible states. The states
are loosely connected to behavioral modes that manifest themselves at the
temporal resolution at which observations are made. However due to advances in
tag technology data can be collected at increasingly fine temporal
resolutions. Yet inferences at time scales cruder than those at which data are

at multiple time scales and can also serve as a means to avoid coarsening data.
Our proposed framework is one of the first that models animal behavior
simultaneously at multiple time scales opening new possibilities in the area

this limits the practical applicability of these estimators in spite of their

for the asymptotic properties of these minimum penalized $S$-divergence

precise conditions under which the two forms of variation are identifiable

circumvents the problem of over/under-registration often encountered in

calibrated to the frequentist inference in that the credible region obtained
from the posterior distribution asymptotically matches to the frequentist
confidence interval obtained from the Taylor linearization method. Unlike the
frequentist approach however the proposed method does not involve Taylor
linearization. The proposed method can be extended to handle over-identified
cases in which there are more estimating equations than the parameters.
Besides the proposed method can also be modified to handle nonignorable

  high-frequency data","Recently inference about high-dimensional integrated covariance matrices
(ICVs) based on noisy high-frequency data has emerged as a challenging problem.
In the literature a pre-averaging estimator (PA-RCov) is proposed to deal with
the microstructure noise. Using the large-dimensional random matrix theory it
has been established that the eigenvalue distribution of the PA-RCov matrix is
intimately linked to that of the ICV through the Marcenko-Pastur equation.
Consequently the spectrum of the ICV can be inferred from that of the PA-RCov.
However extensive data analyses demonstrate that the spectrum of the PA-RCov
is spiked that is a few large eigenvalues (spikes) stay away from the others
which form a rather continuous distribution with a density function (bulk).
Therefore any inference on the ICVs must take into account this spiked
structure. As a methodological contribution we propose a spiked model for the
ICVs where spikes can be inferred from those of the available PA-RCov matrices.
The consistency of the inference procedure is established and is checked by
extensive simulation studies. In addition we apply our method to the real data

alternative approach is to cite confidence intervals for a statistic of
interest but this does not directly tell readers how certain a hypothesis is.
Here I suggest how the framework used for confidence intervals could easily be
extended to derive confidence levels or ""tentative probabilities"" for
hypotheses. This allows researchers to state their confidence in a hypothesis
as a direct probability instead of circuitously by p values referring to an
unstated hypothetical null hypothesis. The inevitable difficulties of
statistical inference mean that these probabilities can only be tentative but
probabilities are the natural way to express uncertainties so arguably
researchers using statistical methods have an obligation to estimate how
probable their hypotheses are by the best available method. Otherwise

variance $\sigma_Z^2$ we show under assumptions that the filter and smoother
are well approximated by a Gaussian when $\sigma^2_Z h$ is sufficiently small.
Based on this result we show that the Maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) estimators are
asymptotically optimal in mean square error as $\sigma^2_Z h$ tends to $0$.
Given these results we provide a batch algorithm for the smoother and filter
based on Newton's method to obtain the MAP. In particular we show that if the
initial point is close enough to the MAP then Newton's method converges to it
at a fast rate. We also provide a method for computing such an initial point.
Our approach is illustrated numerically on the Lorenz 96' model with state

Elastic-Net estimators with $p_n$ diverging. The basic idea first involves
using the trace paths of their LARS solutions to bootstrap estimates of maximum

from the data. We show that differencing out the data further erodes efficiency
compared to drawing inference conditional on the first observations.
  Finally we compare the conditional method with standard random effects

approximations which may not be reliable when unobserved data is very skewed
with some mass at zero values. For example panel data on firms naturally
depend on the first period in which the firm enters on a new state. It seems

within multivariate systems is a difficult open problem. Recently the Partial
Information Decomposition (PID) was proposed to decompose mutual information
(MI) about a target variable into components which are redundant unique and
synergistic within different subsets of predictor variables. Here we propose
to apply the elegant formalism of the PID to multivariate entropy resulting in
a Partial Entropy Decomposition (PED). We implement the PED with an entropy
redundancy measure based on pointwise common surprisal; a natural definition
which is closely related to the definition of MI. We show how this approach can
reveal the dyadic vs triadic generative structure of multivariate systems that
are indistinguishable with classical Shannon measures. The entropy perspective
also shows that misinformation is synergistic entropy and hence that MI itself
includes both redundant and synergistic effects. We show the relationships
between the PED and MI in two predictors and derive two alternative
information decompositions which we illustrate on several example systems. This
reveals that in entropy terms univariate predictor MI is not a proper subset
of the joint MI and we suggest this previously unrecognised fact explains in
part why obtaining a consistent PID has proven difficult. The PED also allows
separate quantification of mechanistic redundancy (related to the function of
the system) versus source redundancy (arising from dependencies between
inputs); an important distinction which no existing methods can address. The
new perspective provided by the PED helps to clarify some of the difficulties
encountered with the PID approach and the resulting decompositions provide

accommodate covariates with a dimension that is not small. Simulations confirm

was used for the basis function generation and $L_2$ projection was used to
create the reconstructions. In this work probabilistic approaches are used.
The probabilistic PCA (PPCA) is used to generate the basis which then allows
the noise in the training data to be estimated. PPCA has also been improved so
that the derived basis vectors are orthonormal and the variance of the basis
expansion coefficients over the training data set can be estimated. The
standard approach assumes a unit variance for these coefficients. Based on the
results of the PPCA model selection criteria are applied to automatically
choose the dimension of the ROM. In our previous work a heuristic approach was
used to pick the dimension. Lastly a new statistical approach is used for the
projection step where the variance information obtained from the improved PPCA
is used as a prior to improve the projection. This gives improved accuracy over
$L_2$ projection when the projected data is noisy. In addition the noise
statistics for the projected data are not assumed to be the same as that of the
training data but are estimated in the projection process. The entire approach

Vasishth 2005) that the distance between linguistic co-dependents affects the
latency of dependency resolution: the longer the distance the longer the
retrieval time (the distance-based account). An alternative theory of
dependency resolution difficulty is the direct-access model (McElree et al.
2003); this model assumes that retrieval times are a mixture of two
distributions: one distribution represents successful retrieval and the other
represents an initial failure to retrieve the correct dependent followed by a
reanalysis that leads to successful retrieval. The time needed for a successful
retrieval is independent of the dependency distance (cf. the distance-based
account) but reanalyses cost extra time and the proportion of failures
increases with increasing dependency distance. We implemented a series of
increasingly complex hierarchical Bayesian models to compare the distance-based
account and the direct-access model; the latter was implemented as a
hierarchical finite mixture model with heterogeneous variances for the two
mixture distributions. We evaluated the models using two published data-sets on
Chinese relative clauses which have been used to argue in favour of the
distance account but this account has found little support in subsequent work

  overconfident expectations of replicability","We show that publishing results using the statistical significance
filter---publishing only when the p-value is less than 0.05---leads to a
vicious cycle of overoptimistic expectation of the replicability of results.
First we show through a simple derivation that when true statistical power is
relatively low computing power based on statistically significant results will
lead to overestimates of power. Then we present a case study using 10
experimental comparisons drawn from a recently published meta-analysis in
psycholinguistics (J\""ager et al. 2017). We show that the statistically
significant results yield an illusion of replicability i.e. an illusion that
power is high. This illusion holds even if the researcher doesn't conduct any
formal power analysis but just uses statistical significance to informally
assess robustness of results.",Shravan Vasishth|Andrew Gelman,stat.ME|math.ST|stat.AP|stat.TH

  observational studies","Effect modification occurs when the magnitude or stability of a treatment
effect varies as a function of an observed covariate. Generally larger and
more stable treatment effects are insensitive to larger biases from unmeasured
covariates so a causal conclusion may be considerably firmer if effect
modification is noted when it occurs. We propose a new strategy called the
submax-method that combines exploratory and confirmatory efforts to discover
effect modification. It uses the joint distribution of test statistics that
split the data in various ways based on observed covariates. The method splits
the population L times into two subpopulations computing a test statistic from
each subpopulation and appends the test statistic for the whole population
making 2L+1 test statistics in total. The submax-method achieves the highest
design sensitivity and the highest Bahadur efficiency of its component tests.
Moreover the form of the test is sufficiently tractable that its large sample
power may be studied analytically. A simulation confirms and elaborates large
sample results. An observational study of the effects of physical activity on
survival is used to illustrate the method.",Kwonsang Lee|Dylan S. Small|Paul R. Rosenbaum,stat.ME

important first step for understanding the latent structure and for generating
hypotheses to be tested in subsequent analyses. However when the number of
variables is large compared to the number of samples standard methods such as
principal components analysis give results which are unstable and difficult to
interpret.
  To mitigate these problems we have developed a method which allows the
analyst to incorporate side information about the relationships between the
variables in a way that encourages similar variables to have similar loadings
on the principal axes. This leads to a low-dimensional representation of the
samples which both describes the latent structure and which has axes which are
interpretable in terms of groups of closely related variables.
  The method is derived by putting a prior encoding the relationships between
the variables on the data and following through the analysis on the posterior
distributions of the samples. We show that our method does well at
reconstructing true latent structure in simulated data and we also demonstrate
the method on a dataset investigating the effects of antibiotics on the
composition of bacteria in the human gut.",Julia Fukuyama,stat.ME|stat.AP

based on the reduced covariates obtained from sufficient dimension reduction.
Compared to the original covariates and the propensity score which are
commonly used for matching in the literature the reduced covariates are
estimable nonparametrically under a mild assumption on the original covariates
and are sufficient and effective in imputing the missing potential outcomes.
Under the ignorability assumption the consistency of the proposed approach
requires a weaker common support condition. In addition the researchers are
allowed to use different reduced covariates to find matched subjects for
different treatment groups. We develop relative asymptotic results and conduct
simulation studies as well as real data analysis to illustrate the usefulness
of the proposed approach.",Wei Luo|Yeying Zhu,stat.ME
